As a high school teacher for 30 years in a small, rural public school in New York state, I was able to. In fact, many students in a positive way. One particular time a student was making what he thought was funny racial comments about another young man and I saw that young man dies, he was quite upset. I asked him what was bothering him, and he shared with me. What was being said, I brought the other young man in and I spoke to him and I said, Do you realize how? Family you are hurting someone's feelings and making them feel uncomfortable. I brought the two of them together and managed to have them talk, it out in which the end result was that. Their friendship was renewed in a stronger way the young man stop making the comments to make someone uncomfortable. And I feel very happy that I was able to make both of them aware of their commitments to one another in a friendly. Manner.	1
A situation in which I was able to positively influence the actions of others. I work customer service daily so I love to talk to customers. I love to learn about this and I have to help us in system. Can you completing what their needs? I want to make sure that we have the best product for services? For now, so when I receive a call at my current job, I ask the customers. Lots of questions, according to what their needs are. What's important to them once they value the most and I recommend a product that is best for them. Exactly I just pray why that is best for them and what they can use it for the benefits. I love it and I will make them understand that their names are important to us when we value customers without the various without customers. We wouldn't be accountable, either. So as a result, the customers are satisfied and they're happy with the results that we've come up with. So I do, I feel I am an asset an I do take pride in my customer service. Don't provide I thank you.	0
Hi I'm so a situation in which I was able to positively influence. Others occured when I worked as a sales manager for Sheraton hotels. I'm during that time, there was one event, where there was a birthday party that was being celebrated and. For that party, I was the person who was responsible for planning and making sure everything was according to the contractuel obligations a month. Everything. And one of the things I wanted to do was make the birthday very special for the birthday person. There was an elderly lady and in this case what I did was bought couple of balloons and uh. Other things, and put them in her room and she is going to stay in for the night so she's coming from out of town. Being able to greet her and then to also surprise her with a few gifts in the room definitely made her feel. So for Chelan, then coming home to see family and she's just extremely happy and it felt really good too. They found her face and to help her enjoy her day.	1
But I'm I have to impact the positive iti of others was when. We had a block party and. There was a little bit of a misunderstanding you know by the basketball park. And. I can tell the situation where they get a little bit heated. So I tried to call me deescalate the situation and come up with a better. Resolution then you know things getting out of hand, the way that they were in. Everything turned out great.	0
A situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others is related to something that is not listed on my resume. I wasn't really important, but the high school middle school levels and it worked with girls to build their self esteem. To drive them further than they ever thought that they could go before an each and every time they succeeded, and I was. So very proud of is the hard work that they put in an it made me feel amazing to be able to install that in them. And Keenum want to push further.	1
Oh, that was a situation where there was a short very short flight. It wasn't supposed to be a beverage. Right but it was hot and the flight attendant outside gonna be the other flights and it was a. So. Usually, we don't do anything but I said let's do a water service. She was like well? How would we do it. So I took out the tray for forgot sing for the water and I will be served an I gave everyone water. Follow very short flight.	1
A time where I was able to positively influence. The response of others I would say was on. OK let. Minute ground stop where we had passengers who were upset that they may miss their connecting flights. And so. We just got all the information that we could since we didn't have. The connecting flight information just going online and just taking care of everybody's needs and making them feel comfortable. Anne also um. Just letting them know that there would be someone to help them and that. They would be OK. And they did appreciate that.	1
So there was a time that I would possibly I feel like I probably would've possibly. Influence access others actions with time I was working in a retail position back in a Southern California at the NCX. Countdown 10 exchange location. There is still we were working as a group I feel like you know, some were giving their all. I would like to think I can say I feel like you know they may have been having a bad day. Or just hired email just giving them. The uplifting encouragement let's keep going to finish this task. Which one is stronger the team definitely helps us come together and finish the project? Hum. An efficient timely and positive manner restate productive. And so again I thought I think back and would say that. You know times do. We're not always. 100% are best at our best I would say, but it takes that one person too. Just a blessed and motivate an or just even lend a hand for extra help. I would say can definitely. Give a better outcome.	0
So one time where I positively influence the action of my coworkers was when we were working for a special event. And. At the last minute hosting the event how to add 100 people, an everyone on this team was very upset because the person. I just said it last minute, even though they had already known. And. We do try to make the best out of this situation and just added more tables. It got a little tight, but at the end of the day. Everything was good. We just have to. Stay positive and stay focused. And remember that, it was for a special event and I guess and stuff like that happens, all the time.	1
OK so I think a time when I had the chance to positively influence the actions of others. Was when my boss the sun pass away unexpectedly and I called my other coworker an ask her to come in? To help me take care of. The customers that were down for the week.	0
For example, the solution in my company that customers were mishandled. Encourage them. Customer service personnel answers online and everybody's looking up to me, but I encourage things in the com. And then everything was nice and motivated Maxwell. Yes, ourselves, then today. Everything was fine and everything went on well.	0
Throughout their college experience hours on the board of many organisations and one way I was able to positively influence actions. Others was by. Advocating for a concession stand in the lobby. In my dorm at first you know, we wanted to have a role kitchen because the? Storm was on campus and we didn't have any kitchen or anything, so we lobbied for. A kitchen and we were denied but I told my team like we shouldn't give up, we should find a way for. Our students to have food and we came to the conclusion an resolution with the status of having a concession stand. In the lobby.	1
There was a time that I was able to influence the positive actions of others by just showing a smile. Every day at work up there were several coworkers that was just going through a difficult time of learning the job so I just. I told him to just smile and just take it day by day and take this just each moment by moment. And just relax and they weren't able to pick up the same attitude that I did an made the job much. Easier for them.	1
One way that I was able to positively influence the actions of others would be. Working with children who are mentally Henderson and need assistance in their daily business. Away too. Encourage him into becoming. Adult setting. Interact with each other.	0
A situation in which algorithm positively influence the actions of others that have to be knee and my most recent position as a delivery associate. I was able to train a customer. I'm sorry, not a customer a fellow coworker. She did a ride along with me and I was able to show her the Rose, she wasn't really sure of. The job of the position So what I did was I gave her like a few hints in a few. Kind of trace alone with you know the probability things at the job so that she can be successful and. Her future with the company. She's having a hard time one day and she couldn't figure out how to properly secure the delivery So what I did was I showed her. This is a great this is the correct way to do it and she kind of felt a little bit better and a little more confident with the position as I was. Showing her the things to do. Access was an influence because me showing her how to do the job and how to do it correctly, then also getting praise from. The managers as well as doing such a great job with. The newcomer. I'm really just prove to me that I could do the job and do it right and then also. Give her a positive look on the company as well as me as a trainer.	0
I work in a restaurant that's just about to open. And during the first day we got a large shipment in and there were so many boxes so much things going on. So much chaos, the A lot of the city know what to do. I stayed calm and assured my coworkers, said, we got this everything's under control and I help control the situation by Delegating. For the things should go and how we should go about it. And at the end of it today went very smoothly. And there was no hitches and the managers were very impressed at my. Ability to step up to the situation.	1
One situation where I was able to positively impact influence others. Is at work in the service industry there? Are you know a lot of Upson Downs but? Maintaining my composure and a positive attitude throughout the entire shift usually helps people. Also maintain a positive attitude. Wow, even when things aren't going their way, so I think doing that helps a lot of people.	0
I am a people person and uhm I influenced them. By being happy and enjoying life and loving what I do caring for others around me and making sure. Everybody is safe and handled well and just making sure they happy and feel comfortable.	0
So a situation that I've had that I was able to positively. Encourage the actions of others was actually at my job that I work at currently we have a system that we use and sometimes are. Customers little bummed out when it doesn't work, where we have little switches. We aren't technology be so when that does happen. I do encourage them to hook up their technologies their phone and use it. That way an usually it turns in right around pretty quickly. And they? Get a little frustrated I would too. But I would find that I have a positive attitude valid it influences. Then to be. More positive and not as grumpy about it.	1
A time where I was able to positively influence other that comes to mind is. We produce an event for special needs for about 100 special news People. We put on a prom and it said. Actually, it's an amazing event and watching the volunteers that come in and make this night, incredible for the 100 special needs People and their families if they choose to come. We just treat them like gold and it's amazing to watch all of those. People and we have meetings and trainings and to be able to tell all of those People about the actions that the other People have taken in the past and how rewarding it was and just. The Amazing night that these. People have and they don't normally get throughout the there like like People without special needs have I think that. Explain telling everybody sharing different stories about things that happened throughout the night. It's very easy because there's more than you can even share. The whole entire night is magical and the stories that are told after an the whole entire night is positive. There's nothing that's not positive about this event so. I think that the question that you wanted to answer I hope so. But. Yeah, so.	0
I work from past 5 years I've worked in juvenile delinquents at the other kids with their own house arrest or the detention.

Hi I, Once was in my store where I probably was his manager for guess retail. And there were customers and employees that were going back and forth arguing. And the employee was getting really a friend and of course, the customer was too. And the employee discount screaming and blueberry. Angry and agitated so I stepped in help the customer resolve the issue with her refunds and this morning he was very upset.

I do remember a specific time I worked as a server for about a year and when I was working as a server. There was a time that I remember having a distinctly difficult time with a number of guests who had been eating at my restaurant. I think it was a party of about 20 there were a whole lot of inconveniences throughout the night that they were out of my hands. They were out of the management's hands. But it was just a whole lot of coincidences that ended up with them having a? Particularly unpleasant evening and I remember at the end of the night when I was hanging from their check. They remain patient and I remained understanding and I remain. Very aware of the fact that they were having a really bad night and I remember them at the end of the night. They were extremely thankful for the fact that I remain extremely patient because I feel like a lot of People who worked in my position probably would have gotten very frustrated and they may not have been as patient with them and I remember how my actions and my ability to stay calm and patient, and have the situation under control. Despite how many of the things we're out of everyone else is control. I think that. They appreciated the fact that I. Attitudes and they left the restaurant actually saying that they would come back and eat again. Despite the experience that they had so it's not necessarily like super positive, but I would definitely say that my attitude made a difference in their ability to have a good time and made it so they want to come back.	0

And always have a good job if you have any good communications amongst your peers and other people and always staying positive and open minded. Bring you Questions in your experiences and you think you must learn.	0

In a timely manner, and neatly and not one person is just doing all the work and when you know you ask people to do things nicely. And you come in with a positive attitude. They're more willing to help out so once I did all that everyone is. I was able to. Get up and clean and get everything done quickly and then my supervisor came in and she was really happy. So that inspired everyone should keep the initiative forward and keep working.	1
I would say one time. And I would say it's probably one of the most important times where I influenced people too. Try to get my way. But I would say it was the correct way, was in my previous job. My previous job was a permit coordinator. For a construction company, paving company. And I could recall there was a time where we design was made where it didn't follow some of the code. And our installers were gonna have some trouble installing the pavement in this location and I came up with a better design. A little bit faster and I think a little bit more reliable. For our installers it would take less time less money and even the customers look at that stuff, they want this stuff done. Professionally and as soon as possible, and also they want to save some money so I was able to come up with a design. I gathered all my data and dumb. I showed it to my my coworkers, explaining why this design had to work was gonna work. It was better. And it would save a lot of time money, a lot of effort and it would finish the job sooner. And keep the little the client content. So it took me about I'd say, 3 days to come up with all the. The data of the designs and stuff. But at the end, it was very well worth the effort because. I was able to show my my peers that. This new way this new method was able to be done even though they had some questions it was. Way better safer and it was more proficient.	0

I went through yoga teacher training after spending many years, practicing yoga and finding the benefits of yoga and meditation.

I actually really love this question one of the moments of sticks out to me the most is actually I was in Haiti. Mission trip at one point and Hurricane Matthew was starting to come and we knew we had to get out of the 90s. 4. Yeah, 94 high school students and we knew we needed to get them out or at least get them somewhere that they could be safe. And I'm notoriously known for being almost overly positive. I think that comes from working at Disney for sale home. But what I ended up doing is just kind of relaxing the kids. We had kids starting in middle school. All the way up to juniors in high school. And they were freaking out and so I thought the easiest thing to do would be to calm them down so I started. Singing and telling him stories and then finally got done able to be able to move about and get them to a place where they could be safe and were. Able to contact their parents. It wasn't an easy task by any means, trying to purge title for lack of better words with. Students who were eager and excited to be able to do some work, and Unfortunately this fails, and so. Just being able to keep that positive attitude and keeping their mind off the situation that is happening and trying to get them to look forward to. What could possibly come? So I think that was the moment but there probably stuck out to me the most where my positive actions influence the others.	1

Might be genuine and sincere with people. What's the weather right? Respectfully ask for help from the clubs and only that I delegated but also shown them what I was expecting. And the reason why I wanted to bring it up is because it's not easy being in college and. Having to worry about yourself and learning more about yourself and then becoming an adult and then trying to. But you obtain your career degree, but it is also better to network with those around you into just showing a genuine kindness. Respect and love to others and the importance of that is what I learn from being able to influence in during that time. Since it started.	1

One way that I've positively influence the actions of others was when I was a supervisor on the operations supervisor at the airport. I feel like having that drive an mentality of this morning to do the task that needed to be done. So that the light could get out on time by showing that to my employees a kind of helps them. So that as well so there is always a positive environment and how I acted as delete team member. Kind of reflected on how they acted as team members and it was always a positive environment because the person. Who oversees died and looks at that type of things when it comes to the? Outlook and this being positive. I feel like if you're in a position and you are either the leader or just one of the team members in the team. Your attitude is going to reflect on others. And if you can maintain that positive attitude and it will start showing in the other people. For instance, if you're not in a good mood. One day that is going to reflect on other people in your team or your employees or your coworkers. So you show about you become that role model an it trickles down to everyone else and you're happy. Other coworkers happy to passengers and customers can be happy as well.	1

Being a teacher, I got the opportunity to try to practice this every day. I got the opportunity to try to turn negative energies with my students and what they were playing with them as a burden.

What they were going through with them walk in their shoes, a little bit. And then we can proceed with the lesson 1. Specific instance comes to mind. The young woman who should have troubled home right. But you know, she was really in discourse to the soccer player. She really enjoyed it so I got the opportunity. One day being in Spanish teacher. She was she was really struggling and and soccer is very popular topic and Latin American culture. So I'm not on the fly.

I got to turn her day into or at least her time with me into something effective where she was able to get something out of it and after the lesson, she actually came up and applauded. For what I was able to do to make Spanish classes one for her. And I mean, I go for any interaction like as well. You get the opportunity.

So while looking for Starbucks. I've worked at very many locations. I started at a low volume store, which eventually during my promotion process. I got promoted to what they call a flagship store a new store that was opening in an urban community that was untapped business area when the surfers opened the productive business numbers word should be about 20,000 per week and once. We opened and we got business running an operating we ended up doubling our numbers by by that amount for about 50 to $52,000 a week, we would make. During this process, we encounter a lot of customers that were just frustrated you know they didn't know the Starbucks culture. They didn't know exactly how to order their dreams or how to just be a customer at times and sometimes it would come up that they were just being mean or rude for no reason and a lot of the partners their partners will be causing poison Starbucks would would get very, very disconnected and not worry about the whole Starbucks experience so I would let them know that sometimes. Our customers don't know our culture and we'll just have to explain to the novel that they comin frustrated. We just have to be nice. We have to do that smile where the one that starts their day. Therefore, whether their day has started on the bad no on ironic good note. We want to make sure that they leave on a great note and there in this particular situation.

Please put a state Animal Party of 10 that I entered all restaurants that also with the party at 10, I had a reservation. And we only had a table for the party attended having reservations so we were able to accommodate those. Part of your tent so welcome Hargitt said. I'm Fortunately we did not have the space for them and they were offering. PS money to actually see them in a restaurant ever wanna ask one of the whole system. Unfortunately, I. I sent the listening to telogen. Unfortunately, we cannot take your money, but I can do it, I can talk to my manager. And see what he can do, we have space not upstairs dining room is not available. So we can try to see this? We could try. To accommodate your needs I went to my manager I talked to him. Last time situation to him, he wanted I guess, he told me that that we can accommodate them. Thinking of having time. I'm very happy about that a lot of the check. They were very happy as well. The employees I was working with. They actually was happy too. They seem that I didn't want to take the money out again. So I want to actually talk to my message. About the situation so it worked out pretty well and I was very happy about the decision I made.	0
Well, uh my havum. Thank you for the questions and how they influence in other People when they need my help in a positive in any situation when when they need my help. I have been bear for example, I can tell you one time when my previous job. I have People that they needed for more training and and they feel a little bit uncomfortable doing the job. They were performing and I was a step enough to them. So I can help them out, making sure that you're comfortable. Doing the job that I supposed to do an after that, they feel comfortable.

Cute decided she was very happy and she thanked me it because of this time, he has an awesome job. That she felt like if it was not for me, she would not be able to achieve that her goal.

Well, the best way to describe helped influence others would be working with Spectrum, which is a cable and cable and Internet company. We are deal with a lot of customer service and we do a lot of business, so a lot of times. It's just being patient, and calm with us with businesses because how businesses are ran and what I do is specially with my team. Is I just motivate them and just give them different speeches and I definitely just let them know Hey? Look we're teaming we can do this. Let's let's try things differently this way. Let's do things differently. Another way, and then what I do is I kinda just. I can't I just. Get motivational speeches together for my team every morning, so we go in. You know there never down. There always motivated to you know push to the next level and that's pretty much what? That's pretty much what I try and do.	0
But every day in my current job right now. I actually work at Target and the people that I work with a lot of them are. Less experienced and I am so they look to me as a role model and as a person to answer all of their questions. An I think that I. Positively influence them by just modeling everything that they should be doing themselves being kind and courteous to guess. Going the extra mile whenever possible if there's ever a concern from a guest or if a team member needs help with something I'm immediately there, sometimes even before they ask. I think it's really important to anticipate situations like that.	0
Back when I was a Boy Scout, Starbucks. I actually ran into a case where a customer came in. And he didn't speak fluent English, he actually spoke Spanish and the brief said that was helping him couldn't really understand him, and she was getting a little bit irritated. Because he kept asking, what it what do you mean? What do you mean and she couldn't understand him? So I went to my broken Spanish. I said como estas como puedo. I'm sorry are you dark day which. Is not correct Spanish at all and all the other briefings? They kind of turned in and they laughed at me and they said. You don't know what you're talking about that's not Spanish. But it kind of created a weird ripple effect where everybody else all the other races that were working at Starbucks. Um started to try to learn more Spanish just because I think one person had gone out my myself had gone out and. Laughingly just kind of. Did it on the curb just to try to help the customer but it actually really improve the work environment because a lot of people actually did start to learn. Finish and we actually were able to help so many more customers. In that area, so weirdly enough that one action was able to influence people in a positive way. I didn't plan on it, but just by trying to help somebody it did create a ripple effect throughout the entire company. Hum. More people wanted to join in because they just thought it was funny and it was a fun way to interact and it was also really helpful to customers. So that was an experience.	1
At my previous job, I was promoted to a manager at a Cricket Wireless location and I remember I had. An employee that would. Basically fight with anyone that did not want to buy anything from him, so every time he would argue and get very angry when he didn't get his sale so. I sent him down. I coached him an I told him the best way to reach these people. It could be genuine and kind. And people will listen to you and want to buy whatever it is that you're selling an once he. Listen to me and took in what I was saying he drop the attitude an his bills and like. Skyrocketed and I always go back to that moment because it was the first time that I ever coached anyone in that situation and it worked out. Very very positively.	1
The situation in which I was able to be able to influence positively was working at Papa John's. We do have an incident where a driver who was underscored the delivery. Hi it's hard working now an I was able to actually activate 2 delivery route stops already actually it was interesting and pick up the rest of the pizza in able to continue in this case. Words. And email so actually had another soda in the backseat. I will be able to actually offer that eh. Apology get for being roughly 5 minutes late and I was able to. Billboard.	0
There was a time where I was working at Papa doughs seafood kitchen as a server and it's a very popular restaurant. And we get parties, sometimes very big partners and so we had this, this party that came in towards the. End of our shift and you know as as far as you know, we, we kind of like to get out of there towards the end and you know we? We definitely don't want to take those lot last those lab papers that we do, if we don't want you know, saying We want to get out of there, we can. But anyways it's a group of us if it is a 3. Three man team and we had a party of 20. And it was towards the closing hours of the of the restaurant and you know, people weren't really excited about doing it. But of course I thought as an opportunity to give these guys are really great opportunity really great experience. And also to really I put money in our pockets, you know this is this is the end. This is a big party. We have to look at the optimistic side about it, I mean, this is this is our job at servers too. Certainly guest getting then give them a wonderful experience have them have a wonderful time with their lives and for us, it just be accommodating sit down. And so definitely wanted to break that down to my teammates to give him that positive reinforcement like Hey, we here. To get this job done. Let's get it done. You know like we're a team where you can get them out of here. In the short amount of time, we just put forth the effort. We stay positive. We have smiles all around. Because you know they can see about the energy and you know they know if you don't want to be there, they can tell you. You have to really say if you don't want if you don't like your job so it's just had that positive reinforcement, Oh my. So, like it was, it turns out wonderful something great.	1
My current job actually worked for 8 thanks so we all work as a collective whole. Previously, we have started different. We have started different programs and everyone necessarily isn't on board with it. A lot of people have been there longer than others, some habits. It just depends. Came up with this idea, where we all just kind of see what works together to kind of figure out. What the outcome is going to be and it kind of helped everybody understand the new process and learning a little? Easier, which that helped a lot.	0
A man to work overtime was wanting to quit her job because the manager had came in and replaced it everyone's positions. Installation. Familiar with the position that she would be doing and she didn't think she could do it and I feel like that. Because I went and talked to her and told her that you know reminded reminded her that we were all a team. We would help her out to do anything that she would need to do and she ended up staying. And she does a great job and she's fun to work with so I'm really glad that she kept her job? I'm glad that I was able to influence her Tuesday.	1
So I actually used to volunteer for relay for life. When I was in college. I created the event. Created the and positively impacting the way again with donations being able to just kind of Pro Act like. Save lives in the meantime, glad that you don't know 'cause. Everyone's been impacted some way or another well, we know someone heard of someone. Or is a family member that has been impacted of some form or another by cancer so being able to be. Not only in charge of being able to watch it grow over the four years I was there has made such a huge impact it made people come along. I'm willing to volunteer willing and eager to learn wake up early in the morning to help set up. And then seeing the People's faces as they did their celebration lap. H is made it all the work all the better because you know what you know you're doing something good you know you're helping others. And it doesn't matter whether you know them or not you're putting a smile on someone's face you're making. Up against huge impact that's going to carry down through the rest of your life.	0
Working in a theme park like Universal Islands of adventure can be very disarming sometimes. Many things happen that we don't have control over like the right breaking down or weather issues and this causes a lot of discrepancies with guests vacations, sometimes when they get mad at us, we have to think of ways to make them happy again. Uh a lot of. Issues can be resolved by just giving against just listening to what they guess is saying sometimes. We just want to vent to others, and other times, turning those situations into positive ones can be very rewarding. I usually give guests express' passes. Once they got off the right after it breaking down and that turns their friends of high down for sure.	0
I was a host mother for many different countries for high school students and I think that my positive influence. As my Rome, Italy student carotid called me crazy American mother. I think that I had a positive influence on them. As host mother, I was able to show him the American way. I also was able to open up their families into my heart. In the United States and it gave me a lot of growth personally and everyone says I'm a hero for being American mother. But they gave me so much more back from all the years that they were with me and I. Still, reach out all of the girls that were in my home from Santiago, Chile, Italy, Germany, Norway, it just goes on and. I think that was something I really provided on the safe home for them and they made me feel a part of the whole world. So I think that that was something that I'm very proud of my daughter and I enjoyed very much having these girls in our home. And I hope someday to go over to their countries and see their world tour.	1
And so tired that I was able to positively influence. Others actions with the time that I worked at Insurance Company GEICO. I had a group of agents that I was in charge of and in charge of training during that process. They felt a little bit defeated because the starting process, there is a little intent. It's a lot to learn So what I did was make sure that when they came in and they felt once it there, I made sure that they understood. Says this is just a small time it gets better after this point, and just let them know small little hacks. That help you get through the day and help you get through a Phone call easier make you feel more comfortable. And at that point when I was able to provide those options to them and provide that comfort to them. They were able to go ahead on to the awesome agents make awesome decisions. An also got promoted and so they definitely enjoy the position at that point just making them feel comfortable. Making them feel that they can do this, I was able to influence how they work, they were able to do better. And their work and they were able to advance because of it.	1
Hello I was in a situation where I had a couple of employees that could not get along and it was affecting the whole team. And So what I did was I talked to both of them and we talked about the way that we can handle this situation. And they felt that the best way to handle this situation was to be really open and to really listen to each other and to communicate. So the situation was that one belt like the other one was. Picking up too much time well on their assigned tasks so we talked about that and how everybody works at different paces. And we also one thing that was really good is I decided that it was really important that we follow up. So sometimes it's a process where you talk about the situation and you decide what you're going to do. And then when you do it, but there's also follow up needed on occasions. So we followed up 2 or 3 times until everybody felt comfortable. They felt comfortable with each other and they were really able to re latency each others sides in regards to. In regards to the situation itself, but also perception so it worked out really well.	1
So something that's really important to me is involvement and I always try and get super involved with anything that like it, such as work culture in college specifically I was in authority and I didn't just want to be in the authority. I wanted to be on the exact board and so I was actually elected to the standards and ethics by President and that was a really great example of a time that I was able to positive positively influence others I was. Able to hold girls accountable to our standards and ethics guidelines and make People came to me if they were struggling with stuff whatever and I was able to talk things out with him and help him out and I think it really gave me a lot of leadership that I continue to use today and take forward with me in everyday work whatever it may be.	0
Uh was that the job where someone asks for product and I convinced him. We don't have the product that we're looking for but we have. It's similar ones. And I convinced him to get that product and at the end, you want to wait for them.	0

In my current role as well. Fargo I am a personal banker and we like to give back to the community. By volunteering. And I was able to influence my team by just seeing amount of different volunteer activities that I've done. They were so influenced that they wanted to participate in a volunteer activity as well so I put together. He volunteer activity for the whole branch, we decided to clean up our local neighborhood our local area that was. Surrounding your branch. So we went on a 2 mile walk together with trash bags. We were our volunteer T shirts and. We all contributed to cleaning up the community around us. This was a situation in which I was able to positively influence my fellow team members. With. Participating in giving back to our community.	1
Um once in my previous job it was a bomb alert and everybody was scared and I was as well. But uhm. I notice that there was some kids in some area in front of me. An I let the parent knows. Hey, I had. I know a place that we can go. Quiet in we can hide them over, there just in case something happens, and the kids was very scary, and when they see me and. I let them know I have a place. I know a place that we can, we can be wild. Why everything happened there was so excited? I let them know I have placed I have something to do with you I have. Books did Robin everything in. They was very comfortable and very happy with it.	0
So influencing the actions of others is something that. I actually feel like I do pretty well on a daily basis. Just my team itself, I'm I've LED teams and I've worked with teams leading teams you know, I'm able to sort of. You know gauge the ideas of what drives the team to be successful for the day and sort of guide them. Along that journey. To sort of keep the productivity as high as we can you know one thing that we did in my old job? When I worked at the Wind? In Las Vegas. Is we had a bunch of people that love to cook we had a lot of hot lunch? But what can we do with those hot legs. So we actually created a cooking competition that was a monthly cooking competition. We have the executive chef from different restaurants in the bakery. Pastry team come up and actually sampled the cookies or this also we were making or with the guacamole we were doing. Different things like that, it was sort of just something that our team looks forward to on a monthly basis. At the end of those, 12 months. I actually took everything and put together like a calendar cookbook type. Type thing of all the winning recipes and then some of the Top finalists, which would you know it was only 40 of us in their team, so it wasn't? You know, too many participants as far as you know a whole plethora of things. But you know, we got a really good turn out, we got a really good positive things on that. And it was just something that the team has to look forward to rather than just coming into doing another. Day or something like that, so I think something like that is. You know one way that I've positively enhanced my team now as far as a guest goes. You know, I do that on a daily basis basis working at Caesars Palace right now. Just my actions in my charismatic ways actually can help drive that guess as we are the first face. That, they see at the Caesars Palace to make sure that they are happy during their stay so that's one thing. 2 things I guess thanks.	1
I used to be a manager for choose Department in a large store that had multiple department's and. When I would hire employees, they just had no idea what it was all about our. Just riding cheese and to people and customers and taking care of customers and just that whole world and just seeing them light up. And here they just thought that they were just going to do a job and just do you know whatever the? Least amount and they just. The light up and realized that there was a whole world out there and multiple careers. And that that passion that they developed just overflowed over to the customers and it was really great to see.	1
Thank you for the opportunity to bring myself to this interview and I just like to answer the questions. Definitely I first I'm done doing my expense career, having a lot of situations where I can influence people. Under I'll order some their actions. Basically, I've been mentor. I've been a leader in Mycareer. So I usually have a people. That are reporting to me as a team and I just like to express one of the items as. Clear one of their situations. I was assigned to a project where he's a multicore cross functional team are different. Diamonds are involving in this area and I just don't have the opportunity to exchange information with that kind of group. Doing that Groupon we analyzing what exactly is going to be the scope of the work and what exactly is needed for. That on purpose, so during that process. I learned people struggling with getting their feedback understanding so I just mentoring them basically. Want one and make sure that they just feel comfortable with the situation and at the end. This person is specifically the scrolling at the beginning. With the situation was achievable during the team and he was successful at the end of the project. We are wired hair. Our network not working there's a statin for her influence on on the on the project and all the conversations and situations that she. Do it during the project so she feel more comfortable with the situation and she got but being promoted. Next slide here to another procedure based on that.	1
Yeah, I will call in a situation where most of mostly for friends or effort to taking the situation. But I was able to because I was able to recover the situation because I was thinking about any worse. Glenlea.	0
How's it going everyone so? A situation where I probably influenced the action of others. It makes me draw back and think on the time when I had my marketing internship at Simon Property Group. We had to run different events. During the summer for all these different tenants that would come by, and one on our 4th of July, which was the. Biggest the biggest event of the year. There was one guide it was 18 years old. And we were swamped with work to do. And he was going to quit on the spot, he was saying that he was done and it was going to let the entire team down. If he had gone because we were already over booked with work to do. And he said that this job is not helping him in his career was not his career path and he has no idea what I was hearing is making minimum wage. And it wasn't worth his time and So what I ended up going up to the person and I end up telling him that there's no reason to quit right now. This is a learning experience to help you transition. Into the dream job that you want guess it's not where you want to be now, but it's a start. To help you get on the path towards the position you want. Later in life because that position, you want later in life. You're not going to be handed to you without having done all this. Experience before Ended up talking into calming down. Thinking about the situation just so that he would not walk out, and we would be understaffed for all the work that we have to do that day. And end up working ended up settling down coming down and we don't get everything done in a timely manner. It would have been super hard if he had left. But I'm glad that I could have come down and help that.	1
A situation where I was able to positively positively influence the actions of others. I work with a PA right now. Don't let your medical assisting with the P. **** airing literally by myself working with her. We see about 20 or 30 patients today and when I'm. Oh, you know other people have had to fill in for me, it's interesting to see how much they appreciate what I do and the amount of time I do it and how I can keep up with everything going on. And they actually love seeing me being able to complete my task. They asked me How do I do it? How do I keep up how? How do I become the affected in officially just like you and I just tell him you know prioritized like? Do what you need to do to get health care for the patient. I'm doing these do for that provider. I mean, then you always come out on Top you might not be able to get everything done at. In the day's work, but if you're able to get the most important things done, which is caring for their patients. You had any issues. I mean, it's just it's beautiful. It's a neat receipt. People wanting to learn from me and wanted to. The waves of patient care and how to be effective at work.	0

You don't have to do that. And I kind of looked at her and I said well. I thought this was, I'll play with employment for all of us and I think it's teamwork. She was very upset with me and she went to the monitor with. With it and actually had a meeting on it, and everybody agreed that I was right that it was teamwork. That everybody should collaborate to make the plays of work, a lot better for everyone. There's really nobody elses job if I had the opportunity to do something. Oh, I am going to do it because. I didn't see more unless of course, by the block. I'm told not to then I will not, but. I think everybody agreed that it was teamwork and then we all came together to make the place over. A lot better for each and everyone of us.	1
Well. Well, I worked as a high school teacher for a long time, and of course, you always deal with some students. Uh that comes from like not a very structured family and there was a specific particular student he was. 15 year old boy and he was very violent, with everybody else. And so when we got the break, I would start talking to him, you know, and I would ask him questions that. I didn't want him to answer to me, I just wanted him to answer to himself. On a day-to-day basis, then I started talking about his routine and the things he was doing and just. Asking questions and making him thinking about what he was saying and what he was doing and I asked her that year. I could see a difference in him. Ann about 5 years later. I met this boy again because I lived in a small town and he really thanked me, he was an adult that already. And he thanked me because he said that all those questions that I would make him.

I have been a police officer for 21 years before I retired and during that time I had the opportunity to become. Our diversity liaison postural physician. I actually created within our Police Department on during the time of the black lives matters movement. I have created this position too. Billion tons to the community so that there was more transparency within the Police Department. I was able to go to town Hall meetings. And. Address citizens in in a more open manner. I'm more transparent manner and they actually had a very positive response to. What the Police Department was doing for them in the community and and also the voice that they had? Come through me to bring back the Police Department. I felt like it was a win win situation for everyone. Really enjoyed being in front of the citizens and and. Helping them understand what the role of the police officer was to the community and how. Oh, they could help us in our roles and how they could help us define our rules because we are there. In fact, for the community so I really did enjoy being able to have that positive influence. On the people that hours dressing and their possible anger towards Police Department got changed to a positive attitude towards them. And I would like to think that I have to say that so thank you.	1
So I had this situation while I was working in fireproof and I was keeping kids club manager. And I had this situation over. Customer was complaining. Foreign bad their customer service and obviously because there was talking Russian. I had to do the translation and. They have a small complain about. The Animation Ann about the customer service, so I had to translate and. And also I'm the animation. It was based on my I was in charge of them animation. So there wasn't really very happy with one. Or 2 terms that it happens. For example, there was very late night loud music and that what we allowed to do as animation team. Entertain the customer so that it was a customer that they they did. They couldn't sleep actually our room was next to the room our conference room. And I hard to deal with that complain so I promised him that next time we try to not. Makes such a big so much noise. And also an invite them to come to our night and see how our animation team list. It's telling and what they doing. And they were really very satisfied for that. And so and then we decide to come from that moment. You have any complaints with just invite all the customers. Another customer, said they they are complaining to come and join us in our entertainment night and if they like. They can come anytime and if not, they can just write a comment what we could do to do better things. So basically there was what we do what we done.	0

In my previous job, I was the operational manager at a grocery store and 4 days. All we, we would have trucks that come in the mornings. One particularly difficult warning R Trucking Lee, we had call outs or short handed. So people are in the best mood 'cause our trucks also come at 5:00 AM so it's early and things were getting off to a rough start. But being managed you have to be able to rally the troops and get everything moving along So what I did was. I challenged my team to certain time frames to get specific taxes done for example, giving one of the Isles done within 30 minutes. And I told everyone that if we could be our best times and get our work done, we would have. I heard what you saying that we do every morning. However, I would make it a grand total where I took the projections of what people wanting. Instead of just doing the usual I don't know like crackers and a new potato chip. I've got avocados. We did avocado chose we had choose. So I think. Being able to give someone a goal an timeframes. I was able to rally our team to get everything done and then reward people for the hard work. And I think having that in mind showed that. We can work together toward something anet. It honestly made people feel better and I have had a better attitude after it.	1
So many other times, working in an office setting. You could get very easily discouraged by sometimes patients. 'cause they're not feeling well. Sometimes they feel frantic because there are 6 and it's easily. It's very easily. Sorry it's very easy to get discouraged there, so whatever whatever I do. I just looked up. Other email just not taking anything personal because at the end of the day, we're all human we're all gonna be with others. Maybe you can't relate to them and that moment. But there have been moments where you probably haven't felt well and you could relate to the patient in that manner that you don't feel well and you don't want to interrupt the folders.	0
One time at my current job. I have to pre pretty much tell everybody that we were gonna be expecting any full notice flights for the whole day. That looks pretty much part of the situation and what actions I took was to find a way to.	0

In high school where I was a cheerleader and I was captain of the team, so I was always influencing the actions of my fellow squad members and teammates so I was always uplifting positive smiling giving everybody great advice and just being a team player with everybody. I was always if you need somebody you could come talk to me. If you just needed some you know like a friend I was always that friend I was definitely positive and. Be an always someone that everybody could look up to because I was the captain. So it was always my responsibility to make sure everybody was on the same page. Everybody was doing a great job learning the things that we are supposed to learn keeping everybody in line and definitely being a positive influence, especially for the younger girls on the team that were nervous for coming into high school I was definitely a good influence on them and always positive and you know just ready to move forward and to give great advice.	0
So there was a time where I was working closely with the community and the job that I had. We were the protocol was to always inform our superiors if there was anything that was like suspicious going on in the homes for something like that, and a lot of People didn't like to do that because they felt as if they could be playing the children who made live in the home at risk. But what I did was there was a time that I felt like. It was. Might have been something that I could help with. In the House opposed to me. Keeping my mouth shut and doing like everybody else was doing. I just you know follow protocol and let my superior knew that. Emails these People may need some help in this area, and instead of them getting found in you know instead of the family. Getting in trouble. It actually was able to help them recover things that they needed in the House and I think that help people in my work environment too. Do the same thing because it was like OK, if you see that a family may need something. It's not necessarily about us getting in troubles about getting the family. What they needed for. I think that really positively influence everybody around me to begin to just speak up about these things.	1

Hey, I meant that they were celebrating but they were kind of trying to Play hashtag and the server may have points to let the manager Know and I myself got all of our coworkers together to try to make it a little bit more special. And and celebrate that time and I remember them coming to me afterwards and just in shock that uhm.

You're around a lot of sick people around a lot of people that it really needs your help. And they kind of. You don't really have time to be a Debbie Downer if if I could say that you know the.

The title and sending them all to Iron Mountain. Anyone have a computer that all we have to do is just log on and refresh. The title and. There we have it so.

I work with a bunch of salesman at work with a bunch of guys and. I'm almost like I'm the only girl there, so I'm kind of they'll talk to gather around with and I believe that my. How I pretend I conduct myself as an influence on them if I'm upbeat that day it tends to circulate around the dealership were a tight knit family. There's only about 10 of us there, so you can influence someone just by walking in with a smile and being productive throughout the day if you are. Had People tend to follow if Europe late customers. People turned to follow an especially think that's true when there's not quite as many of you like in an airline for instance, there's usually just a couple People on the plane who work together and if one person is upbeat and friendly to think the other person will follow just as much doesn't always happen that way. But I do believe.	1
I had a situation where I was able to have a person who I worked in the cargo office. And another airline. An I had a customer come in. I was working in the cargo office. The customer came in.

Can experience at that time and by the early flight? She actually thanked me and she said that I kind of not just lose her life.

Alpha Omega so with that chair you're basically describing to the chapter the policies that they have like in action to prevent any like risks or like any bad things happening like during a fraternity event. And so I think during that situation, one of the big ones will always with our formals or we'd go to another city and we'd be out about knows just like helping them like learn what they can and can't do and just when People would always come to me for guidance like some of the other chairs on the executive board would come to me forgotten seeing if it was a good idea bad idea that there are these events and I would always look through the policies and tell them what that is, and also. Like People would always come to me also kind of like as a Big Brother in the fraternity and ask me. Just you know random questions about life so. Help guide them through I don't know that's probably the biggest situation where I've been able to positively guide them. And we never had a risk management like violation whenever I share so that was probably the results of that, so yeah.	1

I have had multiple opportunities to influence the acts of others. I ran a small staffing and consulting business for many years from 1998 until just recently. I was also very involved in the Association dealing with the industry. I supplied the temporaries and consulting work. Specifically, library, so it was always very interesting to attend meetings where you had a variety of different opinions. Different courses have accidents, etc and they took all of our input and then made a decision based off. Of the consensus of the members. Uh I have had the opportunity numerous times as I have said to actually speak at these meetings and. Influence people to take important a certain course of action one that I remember very specific specifically was that. I was a member of this one committee and we were looking to start an award to recognize professionals within that specific. Field within the industry, an I had worked with a woman, her name was Karen Sweat. He had been a very. Tremendous supporter of libraries, which was the industry. I worked as he had recently died and I. I proposed naming this award after her and there was a lot of discussion about that. But ultimately was determined that this was a good idea because of her tireless. Effort to get people to enter into the field and since then. It's been about 20 years. We have this award within this. The committee that is named after her.	1
One time when I was working at femur. I was sitting in between. These 2 girls that knew each other up pretty well, more than I do. And we were having a conversation during our break. And the situation started to escalate a little bit. I could tell that the girls were not necessarily. I'm agreeing with each other about. The what they were talking about I don't. Exactly remember the conversation, however, as I could tell that the situation was getting a little bit. I'm a little escalated I am. I told him both 2. Take her paws and think 1st about what was being said, I am what I did was I turned to each of them and I said. I think this is what you're trying to say, and I think that this is what you're trying to say. To kind of get them to understand what the other person was trying to get across 'cause I feel that. I felt that what they were talking about they just probably didn't understand what the other person was trying to say. So after I I did that, then they both seem to. Get and understand what the situation was and that they weren't really understanding the other person and after that. Today, the situation is calm down and they were able to come to consensus and nobody ended up yelling or. Or anything, and so everything turned out OK.	1

With the rain and everything so we all just go to the side and kind of like answer questions and just like high like a good day. And. Then there's this one like couple guys that were kind of mad or upset that a lot of the outdoor attractions were closed. And because of the rain. And I took kind to give them a positive and be like, Hey, well, if you go do the inside riding get out of the way. Will have to worry about the ring and probably when you're done there. It'll be done cleared out and you can just go have fun. And people were still kind of like OK how you know it's gonna stop raining and I'm just like. Honestly, it rain everyday for like 30 minutes and then it's done go ahead and snag over I'd like. Inside stuff and you'll be fine and they just kind of like for like Oh OK.

Was enjoying his job a lot more once he realized how easy it was to kind of proud people down? When you were being personable and relatable to them.

I was in customer service and delivery and it was my job to open the store and Usher, new customer. Customers in for the day. And. A simple task of rust. Entering. Um the workplace and once the new customers are are are coming in for the day just, saying simple. Good morning. That's a just just welcoming people in and with an inviting Enerji Because. None of the other my other coworkers at that time were just saying these simple things just just making these simple actions. An telling people hi good morning, and that simple. Um that simple action. Influence the rest of my coworkers and it changed their enerji for the rest of the day and they notice that. An they sent me for it and I think that everyone should have that outlook because at the end of this day. You don't realize sometimes that you're seeing some people for the first time in the day you're the first person that they see. And starting their day off right can change the course of the rest of their days so I just said Hey. Good morning. How are you that's it and it influenced the rest of my coworkers and that made me feel really, really good because that is.	0
A situation where I was able to positively influence others around me on I used to work as a. Assistant manager at a collection agency so whenever I would come into another appear would run into a difficult customer on the Phone. I always you know, walked him through it, always listen to what the customer has to say. Always listen to how they are feeling and you know empathize how they're feeling and make sure that the customer in that person that you're helping. I really understand the situation that's going on and I always you know in there to help other people. And listen to other people's feelings about work or personal life. So that's how I make it positive influence on other people as well. We've been easygoing. I'm able to. Help people if they're going through difficult times and always being there to listen to other people's problems in situations.	1
Well, as you may know I am a firefighter EMT, so I work with a lot of people. And uh we encounter. Different types of situations every day and some of them can be very stressful. So there's been several occasions, where people get upset or they just. They get burnt out you know, and I believe that having. Somebody, who's positive with smiling all the time really helps. Bring up the morale, so I try to be that person. For them and when I I notice when I'm able to do that. When I'm able to bring a smile or a joke or just make the situation that a little lighter. It makes everybody feel better and in that they perform better and they are able to carry out the task. Appropriately and sometimes it's even more funds and were able to enjoy. Today, a little better, so. And I guess you could say I would say that I'm pretty positive as a person I like to stay optimistic. And I bring that to the table for others. Just my positive energie helped influence them and make them. Wanna be? Happier in positive as well, and enjoy the moment, you know, and and just do the best you can. Further.

I am certified as a life coach and one of my business is that I've had in the past. Is doing mindfulness face spirituality coaching so I have had clients that have been stuck in my or they didn't have a? Clear understanding of their purpose or their direction and really lacked meaning in their life in our coaching. Our one on one coaching as well as some of my group programs. In self study programs. I was able to help people uncover their inner authentic self and really get a clear direction for the next steps that they were able to take in their life. This might have been a career change. It may have been a new relationship might have been something, as simple as pursuing their life passions. The results that we found is that people felt more alive, they felt more integrated in their community an in there. Relationships they developed a deeper and more meaningful understanding of their life in their lifes purpose. So my work directly with my clients. Using both spirituality mindfulness and psychology techniques. Psychological techniques helped them to have a deeper relationship with themselves and then go on to create and build. The life that they felt in alignment with their higher purpose.	1

I wasn't dealing with my coworker was over, there and deal with that sounds like a Black Friday deal. And the next day, something had dropped and it was. Cheaper than what her son came in for so with both our policies is. You know, whatever the price we would have like Friday, we can honor it whenever there's like another promotion. I'm so she was really upset so my coworker was getting a tattoo and then I'm sorry it. Got to the point where you know they're both screaming and they're both yelling so I basically just told my coworker like listen like. You can. You know, let somebody you know get upset like you know you gotta understand from a consumer's point that. You're gonna be upset, too because I've already man is like all yet like yesterday. This price is this and then the owners prices then. Hum. And she was like OK, let me understand and she apologized and lady.

Traffic to monitor 2006 Max. 2 former keeping him around high on with the passengers on the plane and then eventually my crew kind of Conan. Is all that it wasn't that big of a deal and if we take?

So a few years back when there was some traumatic hurricanes down in Puerto Rico. I had the opportunity to go down. And bring some doctors down for relief efforts to make sure that all the people who are enacted by the. Perkins had the correct shot. And medical attention so the spur of the moment when a company called me and asked me if I could. Assistant fly down and take care of all the passengers who are all EMTs doctors, nurses that was an amazing opportunity for me, so immediately. I jumped at the situation. Rushed to the opportunity to prep the plane and get it ready for all the passengers who were there for such a awesome. An awesome opportunity to help out in such an awful situation. So. That trip went super well and I was able to take care of all the passengers and they ended up. Staying overnight in 8. Hotel that had no power. It was probably 95 degrees. It was really bad condition, so getting back on the plane and taking care of them and giving them. All the Food and drinks then. An assistant, said they didn't have in the. Hotel was a great opportunity.	1
The situation now is end to positively influence the actions of others was actually pretty cool. One so I was sitting in the break room. With a bunch of my coworkers an they all started talking negatively about a person that had just started with us. And. I've heard that kind of fat, violent for a little bit, but they just kept on going on and on. So what I did was I started speaking positively about this person, giving them some facts about them to try to turn the situation. Around and I kind of thought convinced them all to get another person, a little bit better and now they all love her. So I'm very, very happy I was able to turn that situation around and positively influence them to do the right thing and not really talk behind somebody's back. Before, you get to know them.	1
Actually, one of those. Situations happen to be. Sitting inside are playing that wasn't ready to. Mark. So it became very hot.

Very very hot and everybody was building very irritated, however, finding joy in the moment, realizing English was not the end of the world. Thinking about. Areas and how that Soon, once we open those doors, we would be out in the cold air of Cincinnati. We play this at one point.	1
One of the situations in my career in in my journey in life. To be able to be possibly influenced. Directions from folders who had to be immigrants. Job I used to work for Buffalo Wild Wings for 5 years I was at hotel. And then the server as well and. When are the big things that I ever accomplished in their job it was becoming a trainer? I was always. Working with Michael with new coworkers. Renew managers an my position was to always be positive and to always. Push them to do better in to become better. I know working at a more convenient little bit complicated because you deal with a lot of people face to face. And I know there was longer worker that was having. A hard time. Being. Nice to the customers an building a relationship. So I work with her for a long time and I was always checking up on her. Analysis able to share some of my skills and some of my experiences so she can become more positive. With her actions in which she did, she still works there and she's doing a wonderful job and she heard. She had developed. A very, very great customer service. An yeah, so I was able to be to influence those actions to her.	0
I had a customer that told me the price that I was charging him was not right and instead of me. Getting someone else back there to check right. I walked back there, myself with the customer and I was right on the price. And after that, he brought me lunch for a whole week.	0
A time where I was able to positively influence the actions of others was winter, when I was working. Add I should start I remember I found out that one of my coworkers was giving a discount too. All the customers and then, adding a shoe product to reach it with one of our requirements to be selling shoe products. I'm sure she was getting in the system and then just adding it and telling them that they were getting it for free. So that when I saw that she was doing that I told him to the side and I told him. Hey, I noticed you were doing that and I don't think it's right because in the event that we were to be audited their arguments. Either you're getting all these discounts without authorization and it's just not going to be right. I'm so he did stop doing it because. Although there was really nothing that would say all you can be doing it. It was not ethical to be giving up distances to benefit yourself. And. So he started doing it, which I believe was positive because it wasn't ethical for him to just see. Giving you a discount when uhm it was supposed to benefit his standards of performance and in the event that you know. You want to be asked why he was giving up underneath your couch, he didn't get in trouble because he he did stop doing it. And I was glad that I was able to not help him not get in trouble.	1

With my coworkers, you know, figuring issue I was. You know take the next step and said Hey. You know what's wrong. You know is everything OK, you know, do you wanna talk about it? You know in that influences my coworkers, too. Give Augusta themselves and I always tell him your rocket rocket now. This is your last rocket like it's your last day. I'm really how 'bout perspective as to you know. Live your life, the best. You know it. Life is short live every day. You need a rocket every day because you don't know the next season of rain.	0
So there was a situation had restaurant I was working at. And the customer came in serious at one of my coworkers because. She ordered food before he left and it was down in the garbage. And.

You know further and get the managers because there had already escalated to another level where should know probably never went.	0

A situation in which I was able to positively influence the action of others happen just recently. I work in a hotel. I work in a hotel where we were oversold one night. And so I guess came in and said that they have a reservation and I found out that they didn't have a reservation. And again uh actually I wasn't the one that checks and it wasn't my colleague that checked in together. And when they found that they were trying to put their reservation and he found out that the guests. Wasn't How to read didn't have a reservation in our hotel but the guests said that she thought she had. After that my colleague just told the guys. I'm so sorry you don't have a reservation here and just. Drop the ball at that point. I just tried it. To all the guests over and I said, well what can I assist you with and I guess. This is my first time cooking on a third party? Reservation and so I didn't know that I was not successful. In making the booking in this hotel is my first time here. So what I did was I went ahead and at that time, all the hotels in the area were. Fully committed but I went ahead and they pick the extra step to make a Phone call to all the hotels in the area. And we're able to connect with one of our sister hotel, which is about 30 miles away, and they had a Reservation they have actually occupancy so I asked if they could book our guest that lives with me, who had no reservation. I gave him her number her, her information, I told the managers to wait for her and to expect her. I'll be there for very, very happy. It was her first time traveling alone and so I was also able to arrange for art. Co parts to take the gas 'cause I hotel guests happy and at the end of the day my. Colleague admired what I did appreciated it. They get called back and made a positive comment on social media.	1
So a situation like that in which I've been able to positively influence. The actions of others in my current position, I actually work for a large telecom company. We have a Service called first nut is actually a network built just for first responders when it first came out and lost. A lot of people just weren't really well versed with it just in my store and me, just being really passionate. About first responders being that my father is actually first responder himself. I was able to really just educate everybody in the store on. Hum. On what first met was why it was important, and just kind of you know get some really excited about the product. As a result of that we were actually able to launch and events in our area specifically catered for first responders. I'm with her allowed them to come in to come in get get educated on what our first net. Offer is and why it was important to them and that day. I think we may have signed up at least like 70 first responders which is really exciting. At the time I was living in Orlando, Colorado, Oregon. Sorry I lived in Colorado. I was living in Orlando, FL. And we it was hurricane season, so it was really, really important for all of our first responders to be able to come in. And switch over to that just in case of an emergency. So yeah, as a result, like my entire store was able to. And you know when like Top spot in our. District for the amount of 1st responders. We signed up and it was just really nice seeing just all of us. Do that as a team and be able to provide that service for first responders.	1

Lab instruments that had not been properly. I guess care for in the past or attendance or in the past. Where? There were incidents that occured and there was no trainings that took place of thereafter. So when I was brought on board, it was my job to assess. And create a prevention plans and then provide training and then some practice drills so that people would understand. What the responsibilities were in the event of an actual situation? And what I did was then I looked at. The prior incidents the prior records and then just kind of understood exactly what was missing where the gaps were. Swimming training issues were there materials issues. Was their lack of accountability with their leaders for their leadership issues? So what I've done before with a plan so that people could actually understand what their responsibilities were when they needed to take action. And exactly what the steps were, but they needed to perform in order to complete the task safely. And in that and recording that documentation and then hosting practice rose, ensuring that people were were safe and. Accountable. Everything at the site going forward.	1

We do get a lot of snow in upstate New York. And I'm restaurants. The back doors are never shoveled and the drivers have to deliver food product through the back door. And restaurant managers are very busy and cannot trouble the back in the front for the customers. So I went out to each location as many as I could and ask. Set the shovel at least in area for drivers to pull their product and safety so they wouldn't get hurt. Slip and fall and I they were reluctant to do it. But I had every driver bring rock salt in the shovel in their truck and when the restaurant manager saw our drivers diligently shoveling. Their way into bring product. The managers decided to send someone out to help so I believe that was a positive influence not directly asking. A task on someone, but Showing that how safety of our drivers was important to us, they decided to help out. So I think that was a positive outcome on on on our part as a whole for a team. In 50.	1

They were trustworthy they made sure to do things right the correct way, the first time rather than having to redo themselves.

We had some interesting customers come in. They just were not happy with the situation and then as a supervisor you're supposed to step in and email kind of. Tracing down and it was very nerve wracking because there were you know, some racial slurs there were some threat. Involved. But we kind of I got my supervisor and then with me. We kind of diffuse the situation on. We got our Taylor's actually you know turn it positive they really diffused everything made the customers feel very comfortable. And then in the end, they end up leaving at the start bar review. I'm sorry. I think just because we were very welcoming. Smiling very attentive to what exactly the issue was and not really reacting based off of emotion or what they were saying, we kind of took. Ann. Our emotion, and personal feelings out of it and just you know went for what the actual issue was and tried to help resolve the problem. So. That is a good situation, I think.	0

Working in the cruise industry for about 33 years, so many times we would get guests that were. Uh they were tired from traveling and they would come into a situation, it just be so frustrated an. Little to calm them down and to let them know that their expectations would be exceeded on the individual cruise. That was very, very rewarding. I usually had an opportunity to let them know that everything is going to be OK. And then moving forward is going to be, it's going to be very positive and that I would take. Personal responsibility for making that happen.	1

So growing up, I was always a part of a dance team, during my senior I actually had the opportunity to be Co captain. Able and I was able to demonstrate my leadership skills.

These that school was getting too much to them. I also put that time, if anything was going on. I would talk to them on the side to let them know it is this too much for you right now.

For me personally this question in which I'm asked to describe a situation where I positively influence the action of others is very easy for me to answer. In a previous employee Employment Opportunity that I was currently out a risk management consultant. I was tasked with visiting different restaurants and. Supermarket and possibly influencing the way that the managers. The way that the managers are dealt down or delegated tasks that improved safety, so the purpose of me visiting these locations was too. Make the location safer for patrons who were there to visit or shop and so I would visit the locations. And make observations in which they could make positive improvements, so I believe that my direct. Presence there was able to positively influence both the experience of the patrons in also the experience of those employees who are working there. I'm making it a more positive culture and a more safe location for everyone who visited.	1

Said sorry about the inconvenience the plane will be here as soon as it can, we just gave them. Updates and then every 10 to 15 minutes. After the game it just explaining the situation and what happened. We kept everyone calm an when the flight actually received in Wisconsin. We were able to get it out in. 41 minute turn everyone was you know, happy that they got there safely and.

A situation where where I was probably able to influence the actions of others was recently we had a A passenger who was panicking about getting on the flight, with your first time playing. What I did was like the passenger another was going to be OK? Anne I communicated with the other product and it was on the aircraft with me and let her know what situation I was going on and she also reassured the passenger that. Everything is gonna be OK and we actually gave the passenger some of our first class next because you. Sitting in the main cabin extra area and we also just make sure you have a pleasant flight. Let him know his connecting flight information. And we also when we made it. We made sure we gave him over to the gate agent, so she can assist in getting to the next gate.

Everything at work. As a manager at coat. We do what is called a posting ceremony which means that you were the fair bleed on the floor. So every day, I get an opportunity to positively influence the actions of others. I usually go and tell my team, but we need to make for that hour. Ann Blair, we need to improve and I'm able to go through an positively help. Everyone in the store so I can help my coworkers to help them be better sales people I can understand. Other customers so they are finding the product that they need in there, having an enjoyable experience. So every day when I'm a Co host. I'm able to give everybody a positive experience or when I try to. Africa. The people that I work with I'm encourage them to do better meet their sales goals and if they are not. Figure out a way that we can make this happen.	1
Being able to passively influence the actions for others instead. Working in Aberdeen customer service. It's very stressful I know. But. Being like a friendly happy person the script impact others. For being unhappy. Friendly as well. So if you have like attach this light you could influence others. So if you're alive. Being stressful. Being so rude. Are being so sad at work? That could impact others as well. So it's like a domino effect. So if you were just being like active. Being friendly with others. That would imply that could influence them to being active as well at work. I think that's The into our positively influence for the action for others.	0
I've worked in a kitchen environment for a really long time, so I've learned that some of the best ways to positively influence people. Is by helping them? So I know that when our ticket system goes down or we get really busy alot of the people. Inside of the kitchen will get super overwhelmed and won't really know what to do. So one time that happened, I figured upon me to begin to help each person ask them what they needed. I know how I could assist them in any way to make them feel better about the situation and help to relax everybody. And at the end of the night. All of the food went out well the ticket times were. Much better, even though they were all handwritten by the servers and the staff in the kitchen in general. All felt better about the entire night so I believe that positive iti in any situation helps too. Keep people where they need to be and hold them together and as long as. I can stay calm and collected and organized it really helps out other people.	0
As a former nurse I was able to take care of patients who did not feel very well by themselves and we're having trouble understanding.

Well, there was a situation where I worked in my course as a supervisor in spell sleep and most of the time it was competitive. But same time, it was also the importance of building clientele an actually carrying with providing the best service to our customers. So with my type of approach is telling what I usually like to do with the van we each customer. To better give him what he wanted an with the needs rather than just fill them something they may not want. Or something they may return the way I approach each cell was precise to kind of guarantee myself that sell and not have a refund or return. So that was a supervisor sells weed and we did have to reach quarters. I felt like that type of. Positive approach and that more of a I just want to get a sale done was what made my staff be a little bit more. Positive so it in my opinion, a game. The Michael Kors store that I worked at a better experience. When you walked in you will be green, it an you would have an experience rather than just the one. In your face trying to sell you something an you would have more of a relationship with my staff and my employees.

Looking customers that wanted handbags from Michael Kors and they wanted something that was not animal made or they wanted something that was for a specific use. So with that type of. Situations how you would handle them will determine if you were a good salesperson or not or overall just a better customer. Service. Improbably and I was, I felt like I was able to influence and impact my staff. Bipennate teaching them that kind of a? Approach in that perspective and selling.	0

Ultimately went in and I got the item that she had wanted and she was very happy with it and. So we should be satisfied with the customer service that I gave her so.

Send me would be able to go home and to buffer that waiting time for them to be able to leave the facility I. Actually had catering bringing pizzas and sodas and stuff like that? Which. Was not a force being expended sure but definitely something that was worth it because they ended up not only counting the merchandise. Expeditiously, but the margin of errors was reduced immensely so they were happy I was happy I was not. Again, I was not for seeing that expenditure, but definitely it was the cost of doing business and the return on. That margin was immense so for me. That was definitely something that was good and and also his state that it. Increase the morale of the team to see that we were taking care of them so All in all. Even though it was a Tiring and taxing situation and we had gone over what was expected. The outcome was good and then when they actually put their nose to the grindstone we got done. Faster than what we could have anticipated for the workload that we had ahead of us.	1

Other people and their ability to. Blacks when they get home and how they're 1 action or their activity in their apartment can affect others. In the building so after talking to them and being able to convey to them that they do live in a community. And there are quite a quiet hours from 10:30 on there were able to see how they that resident was able to see how they fit into the community.
