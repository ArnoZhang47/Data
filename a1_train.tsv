This would be a fashion show will turn a couple things if you like it. That's great if you don't that's fine. So my main goal my main mission was to just take care of my customers. And just to make her feel comfortable because I can understand it being a woman. I understand the changes that we go through with our body. She agreed and we look around store and I picked out a couple outfits were We went into the sitting room. Extremely comfortable, she tried on the merchandise, she came out.

Want to say one situation that I can remember in the past couple years when I was managing the political campaign. And there was a young man who? Unfortunately, I think he'd been falsifying data and what that means is you can going door to door falsely. Actually, not been doing the work had been putting it in the computer. I found out because he was at his house and I guess, he didn't think that I could track anything. But I did, and I didn't approach him in a mean way. I like to give people second chances. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt. So I talked to him and as it turns out, he actually was going door to door, however, he had. Written down the information before hand and I verified this by talking to some of the people that was. Each one of those doors to make sure that he actually went there and so it turns out. Not all situations are what they seem but I did talk to him about that and I made? Sure, to or keep it between he and I but, I did have a discussion with everyone else. Later, not about him. Of course didn't mention him. But I encourage them to understand the mission of why we were there why we're doing what we were doing. And that encourages everybody to always be truthful and honest in their answers and what they were doing because. The most important thing was to complete the goals that we had, and if they want to work at another job. They could have, but that really strengthened peoples. Outlook on that campaign and it made sure they understood the real reason why we were there an in any situation if I see. Someone, who maybe needs help encouragement or they need a little guidance in the situation. That's what I've always done whether it's. Being a coworker or being a manager in certain cases, so that's one of many examples, I could give.	1

She even cry on my desk, which was a first for me only been advising for a couple months at that time. So I so it doesn't work for me, so I really didn't know what to do, but I kind of put myself in her shoes. And try to understand where she's coming from either insuring myself so I understood you know how I might feel for leave. Sherlock London Meteor friends behind Tigger proper semester, so the first thing I did was conquered down let her know that. She had a really good opportunity to pick between 2 options, not many seasons usually had that. Opportunity, I gave her all the information. Instead, about the locations. I connected her to people who were from. Those 2 cities where she could study abroad to, I connect her too.

Yeah, so there was a situation at work on my work in the education industry industry. Currently, where people were complaining about working overtime just because we had a lot of students that need a service. So during that time you know, I just bought a lot of sense of humor, bringing my my positive iti. Cottages linear body know has you know, there's kids out there that need an education that are looking upon us too. Put them in a better place to listen to their issues. So just to put yourself in a position to be negative isn't really something. That we should be doing you signed up for a job and we're doing something to impact the community. So with me, I would like to bring my positive attitude migrate interpersonal skills just making the the atmosphere more upbeat. And not really focusing on the negatives. Yes, we have to work overtime, but we have a good reason to do it. So that was pretty much my situation. The outcome was amazing. People started saying. Hey can you know what you're right? I didn't think of it like that and You have kids on my own so someone was to put them in a position like that I would definitely understand. You know this thing out there and make sure that we're going above and beyond, to focus more on the students. In matching Easter benefits to put them in a better position for them in their family.	1
I came into work one day and like a full chef attire just as a joke, one day just to lighten everyone's mood. I came in and was all smiles, laughing when it was already a pretty mellow day except the code for the day and had everybody ready to work.	0
Scroll and time in action, I took to influence. The The Positive, a positive importance of others is when I was working at Footlocker. This was on Christmas Eve. It was extremely extremely busy we had came via started work at 8:00 AM. It was already aligned at the door as soon as it was 8:00 o'clock because we had a lot of. Last minute shoppers so I notice an hour into work. Most of my coworkers were already done they were just exhausted they were over it. And I set up a routine like Hey. This person, saying the kids section while this person standing men men section this person staying a woman section. So we would rotate every hour, so we weren't feeling overwhelmed. We weren't feeling overworked 'cause again extremely busy. We had a huge sale not. Only did we had an extremely shoe sale. He had a new release sneakers coming out in the time that I was working at Footlocker Sneakers. We're just in all time high. It was very popular to have stinkers to own a pair of Jordans. So I always get the new releases so I motivated others to say positive to be calm under pressure destiny have customers yelling at us. And being angry, sometimes a little violent pressuring us to move faster or yelling at the person at the Register to ring faster 'cause. They didn't want to stay in alone for so long. So I was able to find ways that we could be able to pass on it be able to. Rotate and not feel like we're doing stuff at the same positions for the extended of the day because yes, we came in at. ATM and even though we close the store at 6. We actually left at 8:00 PM is a 12 hour shift. So that was my way of influence influence the others to just do well.	1
So a situation where I was able to positively influence actions of others. I would say it would be. A few years ago, I had the opportunity to work at a summer camp. I worked with the children about 46 years old, and I had this little girl who was autistic and severely ADHD. I've never worked with a child that had that paper. Um. I don't wanna see disability, but that kind of mental disability and. Essentially, it's really difficult 'cause. She was 4, 1/2 years old, and all she wanted to do was. Print off and go and find something that she wanted to do, and she didn't want to deal with other little kids were doing. It is really hard, it was really stressful, but I was actually able to. Do my best and pull through an I was with her for about 5 weeks and it was to the point where her parents were so proud. So thrilled of how far I came with their daughter that they actually wanted me to come and be. There are many for that fall, Unfortunately, it was in school, so I wasn't able to. And then the growing somebody asked me to go back to the camp and be her counselor again, so they were absolutely thrilled that I was able to connect with their daughter. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go back and let summer as well do it, having a job. But I still kept in touch. The parents are just always so happy and I just I love that I was able to influence that little girl. And completely Turner somewhere around from being something that they were so afraid that she wouldn't be able to have fun to be in the bathroom of her life and. She's 7 now and she still remembers every minute of it, so that's just great news for me.	0
So I was able to positively influence the actions of others. I'm doing my time at the law firm every Monday. We have a meeting it was our Monday meeting. And every week, we would choose one person to speak positively about and we would go around the people. And we would say 3 things that we appreciate about that person and 3 things that that person was good at. Other jobs and it really helped to boost everyone's confidence and to keep working well and hard and. That's So I was able to positively influence the actions of others.	1
Hi. I went on a mission trip last year where I was. Helping kids 2. Adjust to flying back to the United States. With me and they were very scared in had never flown before our left their country. Hum. I was able to help them calm down by explaining everything that was going to happen on the flight and. Making it more exciting for them. That one experience that I've had recently that I wanted to share.	1
I would have to say that during my career of community management. I drove his team of 48 arms. Purity and 35 members in a recreation staff. We had monthly meetings with homeowners in a community approximately. At 10,000 residents reside in and just building that strong team and providing the leadership for the team. Are being proactive and reactive at the same time? Alright built a great team and I could not have done it without my team.	1
And the situation that I can describe where I positively influence the actions of others was during my flight attendant training with compass airlines. I remember You know, everyone was kind of having fun and we were just sort of celebrating being done with our training. And that we were getting to our time limits for having any alcohol drinks. And so I made sure to just step up and be a leader and tell everyone you know, we can't risk our job. For this so. I feel like I had a positive outcomes because nobody got in trouble and then it was a good ending.	1
I have. Then instructor for my previous airline and. I always had to give them positive feedback that they were able to do this job. I know what they look for in their eyes were they were intimidated by what they're about to learn. But to to give them a positive experience takes more than just. Telling it you have to have them embrace it, see it touch it feel it and get confident with it and. That brings on a positive. Siri inside themselves that they are able to. Prepare themselves to learn what they are about to learn in to accept and embrace it, and be comfortable with it. And. Be able to. Produce it and Can't see it with the confidence. So that's what I would have to do is build up their confidence feeling that they are successful.	1
So the answer to this question a task where? I was able to positively positively influence action of others as a supervisor at the goldfish from school where I work. We are able to provide a great swimming experience for the kids that we teach and also for the. Teachers that teach those classes, so as a supervisor. It's my job to make sure that the classes are. Run on at 8. Any good good standing, you know make sure that safety skills are matched. And then the teachers as well, and it's a good way for them to provide a great experience for the kids. But it's also good experience or an experience for me to see that the teachers that work on my surface. Hum. Did your second working my shift on influence? The actions of those kids, though. On every day, every every every every day that I work I provide like who did the best job so it's my way too. Show my supervisors or my. My managers to tell them which teachers are doing the best in which teachers that I think. And that would be good for a company maybe supervisor or trainer, so it's a good way for me to. Uh point out. I'm who's doing who is doing the best in that situation.	1
As a social worker. It's a daily task for me to represent and give my customers and clients the opportunity. Are you sure that I'm providing them with safety so that is? When I have to do this reassuring them? Giving them the assurance that they can do it. They have what it takes to do it, they have the potential. And they had to keep trying because on a daily basis. We are faced with so many challenges and they're not. Aware of how to properly raise and keep their children safe and that is my job to ensure that they know. That I am here to influence you and give you a positive feedback every day.	1
At my current job now we have this thing called champion and challenge, which means at the end of every day, we go over with our team. OK, this is your champion as in this is what you did, really well on and then this is your challenge. And how you can work torwards. This challenge and the challenge is essentially something that they did not do so well on. But they always have room to grow and so one time I was going to sign with my jobs. And we were setting everything up and the employee did not do exactly what they were supposed to be doing so, then I went up to them at the end of the day. And I said, Hey this is what you're supposed to do you're not in trouble but this is how you can grow? And the result was that a couple months later, they were doing exactly what they were supposed to do. And they took it as a growing experience, which is what I also took it as a growing experience.	0
I think 8 ball out of Georgia, Atlanta, GA and we were in the middle of a game and it was like the score was tide. 4 to 4 and one last ending in 2 hours and we were up to kick. The person who replicate she was so nervous because the game ultimately relied on her if we were able to take home the championship trophy or not. So I was able to you know talk to her and calm her down, like you know just practice what we practice. All the time we are able to do and in practice, so I'm more than sure that you're able to do it in the game. So just have confidence in yourself and believe that you can do it and I'm more than sure you can succeed. And when she went out there, she was able to kick it in the outfield in the bar wasn't caught. And was able to bring in 2 home runs and we won the championship trophy.	1
There have been several situations where I've had to influence the positive iti. On others actions. As in a different position that I'm in now. I currently work at a treatment coordinator. Where I only basically work of dental treatment for patients who need fillings crowns but things such as that? Implants and those prices can get really high and they're really shopping for certain people and a lot of people do get frustrated at the amount that they have to pay in order to get their oral hygiene back up. I'm So what I tend to do for Chrome. Those people down to reinforce that that positive energies stays positive. I do what is called a look and understanding in a sound so I kind of you know show empathy to the patient? You know, and let them know that I understand that I understand their situation and kind of put myself in their shoes and then also let them know. Comparing to the other people would I have found out to be the best results and I signed that that works pretty well. With coming keeping those positive actions with those patients and things like that, so I think that I can be a great. Um at that to friends here because I do have that skill in relating and understanding and letting them know the best results that I have found?	0
So, in a situation I was possibly able to influence people with. As worked as a cashier for so many years at different places. The place I found really fascinated with when I worked at the airport. Um so I had a way to interact with customers to make them understand what we go through being at the Register and how our process. Is handing out stuff so just in case if you come in like all crampy like not in a good mood or anything. I will find a way to. Make you feel comfortable. Make you have a mood change. That's just me. That's just how long the ground and I always want to work and make sure. Everyone around me is so possibly influenced so energetic that's what I want and that's what I strive for everyday is working. And I always want people who feel comfortable and have the best in. It's their wealth. We do have rough days that people get angry all the time people don't really understand. But I think a good heart a good interaction with them get to understand them. There also partner human he knows. You have to understand your customers and make your curve misunderstand you that's like an everyday thing.	0
When I was in high school I was nominated the captain of my cross country team and as the captain. I felt that it was always my responsibility to make sure that everybody was doing the right thing. And not everybody felt good, even if they didn't do their best. So during regionals, we had a chance or woman's team had a chance to go to state so I. Prepared a big dealing with the women's team and we talked about our dreams and uh we talked about. Are aspirations as far as regionals an our goals and what we wanted to do so and we also? Have some girl time and was able to. Come together as a team, so I feel that. My accent is pulling my team together and trying to uplift them before I really big race made a positive impact. We did not end up going to the other team, but we did bond closer as a team and I think that was. Honestly, the more important lesson that. I got out of that experience.	0
Hi my name is Joel Mayhem and thank you for this opportunity to be considered for Frontier Airlines 1 of the things I can tell you that I would be positively. Affecting others is a situation where there was in my case, I had an experience in customer service hospitality meal service catering etc. And we have a situation where somebody was not able to eat a certain meals so that was because of allergies and so I asked whether or not. It could be a staff person would be willing to substitute or give up their meal in order to make the customer happy. And sure enough that was the way it worked, and the person who received a meal, which they were so grateful. And so thankful and you know what it was a very positive customer experience gave them a very positive. Experience in thinking about the brain and an remembering us in part of that I feel is customer retention and I. Are you being excellent person in keeping your customers happy and keeping overall philosophy of great service and service with a smile.	0
Hi how are you today I'd like to explain a situation where I was able to influence others and in a positive manner. I spent 4 months in Malaysia. I was on printing island, I decided to go to. Uh help endangered sea turtles, they were Green Sea turtles and we also helped restore the artificial reef during my time there. One of the things that I. Thoroughly enjoyed it every night after dinner, we would give a presentation to the hotel guests and explained to them. What were the main causes of of that were basically endangering the sea turtles on a lot of that had to do with recycling and plastic. And there are poachers, giving that presentation. I thoroughly enjoyed also another great highlights and during that time period was. Being able to wake the guest graph when we had uh see turtles come. Enough during the night we got to bring the families down and they thoroughly enjoyed that so the situation was. Basically, education for all of the guests and then the action was for us to make sure that we were educating the hotel gas and getting them excited. And letting them learn about how they could help the environment and keep our ocean water is clean, and hopefully the result. Is to help preserve the ocean for future generations?	1

Working in the airline industry. We did just have the Max 8 that went out of service, so for my job. We had to go through and re accommodate all of our passengers. It was a very stressful time and a lot of our employees got very overwhelmed and frustrated. So I went in one day when everybody was just very frustrated with the process and we just sat down and we talked. And you know, I listen to everybody. Um concerns and I explained to them. Another outlook on how we should see this situation so that we aren't taking our concerns out on passengers. Or even other employees and it really helped turn around the outlook of a lot of our employees, so that they? We're showing a lot more comfortable with the Max 8 grounding Anri accommodating or passengers and it was a lot more helpful for our passengers, so they had a better experience.	1
Right so the question was a situation where I was positively. Um able to. Describe an action well.	1
Well, I have been in the restaurant industry as a server. And there was a time when I was able to do just this, where I am. Wanted to make a customers. Experience. Very special is a very special occasion. And I know all the servers are very busy. It's hard to take time. Out of your shift or working with your table. The call and just you know. See a part of. Either singing or congratulating a customer, but it was such a monumental occasion that I thought. That you know which is all. Be positive towards this particular customer. It was a very special day for them, they were reuniting with a family member that they have not seen in so long. So I got them all together and one of 'em. Video recording another one taking pictures. And everybody in the restaurant is that kids can guess what we were doing so, they were in our two so not only was I impacting. The customer and my fellow servers, but the people in the restaurant as well, and together we were all able to make it very memorable. And is very exciting time.

Hi to describe a habit. To positively influence others a situation, I would like to say that in training at one point in time. Since I am currently replied Attendant had a small group of girls. It's tough everybody gets really discouraged but. I think that's the time and place it to instill positive influences and help each other out that was during training. I think encouragement stepping up to the plate, helping others to succeed in the same industry that we all really want to be in. And we just formed a really good group and I think it really was that little push over the edge to help are. Teammates in our partners during that Catherine the training but, I felt like that probably the most positive influences. That I could really in still at that time so.	1
While working at Dillard's Department store, while in training there are a few girls who. Where was willing to give up and thought that just because the first day wasn't so well that you know? They didn't want to come back so I called him and I let them know like every job is not going to start off easy. There's always going to be moments where? Really, thinking that maybe we're in the wrong path. We're doing the wrong thing, but then if you stick it out actually give it a chance. Then you'll see that it's not as bad as you're building, it up to be in your mind so after. Eating lunch with them talking to them and you know persuade him to stay for a little longer at least trying to do the week of training now. I was able to gain at least 5 other girls to stay versus the 10 that wanted to not stay. Play me feel better.	0

And that's where I learned to build portfolios and also talk to clients about their long-term goals. What they were looking for and what they wanted to achieve?

People. To really build their futures. And I did it with lots of clients over almost 20 years in that business and I'm really looking forward to. Influencing others in a new karere and that's why I'm here so thank you very much.	1
During my time as a banquet server. I was. I'm a music with server, meaning that I was in charge of the staff of. Servers during a Party or event, one event in particular, I can remember was. Quite difficult dealing with the. Guess of the party and my servers became very agitated as well as the guest. I did that and I knew the only way to get through the evening without any agreement on our. In. And I'm sure that they just still had a good time window. Maybe the way we do things and they wanted us to do things. Didn't quite mesh well I had this set my team down. Select a brief members meeting and just kind of talks on this function like listen. You may not like it, but this is our job isn't what you signed up for. We we do events with thousands of people every month and not everybody. Is going to get along well but and I'm told him I said listen? I go again today still to make sure that event goes off well, that everything that they get in the host. Password that do.

He received a huge step because the host was very impressed. With our professionalism and how the? Party turned around the email from other guess they were helping in the samples to us.	0
I can think of many instances where it had this opportunity on the job. But my most recent experience I would say. Is the training 6 weeks training 6 weeks of training that I had and positively influence my classmates by? Dedication by my positive attitude and just to respect that I gained from my fellow classmates because of the respect that. Skype for me and I was able to portray for them. And this very grateful to have that impact on them and. I can think of opportunities that I've had this informer positions that I've had as well. I'm just somebody known to go above and Beyond and I think that that. Is something that? Influences others to do the same definitely to be genuine and for them to be able to recognize that. Inspires them to do the same.	1

They couldn't and also at the same time that I went. I got them a bunch. Bottles and I gave it to them, so that way. They weren't having a fight over just one single water bottle. And once their family was getting ready to leave the little boy came up to me and he was wearing it.

Mirrors of course, some discrepancies in the district with his voting records. So he of course, did not see value in registering to vote. Or being part of the process any actually had some frustrations just with where he particularly particularly moved from. During that situation, I was forced has with explaining of course, encouraging him to wrote an influence him to both. So I simply just had a conversation with him in which I was able to simply explain the value of voting. Uh or registering 2 girls, so they actually when I said was. Registering him to vote after explaining to him, the benefits of being a part of voting and having a voice. In that particular process and it of course, resulted in a happy customer that ended up voting in the election. Or the local election recount thank you.	1

I would say the biggest instance of when I influence the actions of others positively will probably come when I was working with children you know. At the YMCA are big deal is that we're role models for not just the children but the parents as well in the community. At large, but I would say that one instance. That I probably influence behavior, possibly the most. Came in to my girls were pulling in as little girls had special needs. An basically what happened was the little girl special needs, said that. You know she. She's moving back to Mexico even though she was she was born here. I don't know why she said that her dad was from Mexico, though. Not really sure where that came from, but two of the little girls who are bullying. Her they used to be friends and Whatnot and stuff. They were always hanging out, but then all of a sudden. Things change pretty much around this time. And so that came to my attention and I set them aside and I was like Hey like. You know what happened. Why did you say that this year and they try to lie to me and I was like I know? Did you send it because in adult told me that this is that you said it. And so basically what I told him was, I was like I want you to think about the person who loves you the most in this world. And they both had their mothers. And so I was like well. I want you to know that Sierra has a mother who loves her just as much. As you do. Or just as much as it as your Mother's love you. And I want you to put yourself in the mom shoes an trying to think about. How you might or how your mother might feel if somebody had said those hurtful things to you and you know they just started bawling and like crying and stuff, and I didn't have to be mean or didn't have to raise my voice didn't have to do anything really. Besides you know put it down for them, but I think my what I was modeling there was empathy an. Compassion and so, yeah, I think I definitely possibly influence them and the results of that situation was they. Within about a week, there, you know, hunky Dory again hanging out being friends and what not just like. Just like old times.	1

OK, so I'm currently at an internship with teacher acts, which is the computer tones home goods TJ Maxx and Marshalls. An I'm doing loss prevention there. And so our associates have guidelines that they have to follow for looking in baskets and looking at their cards, so that they can reduce shrink and so recently been having some issues with them, not checking or not doing things the way they're supposed to so. We will I came up with the idea to do a Bolton bored in the break room for them and and Kyle just it's like a monthly shrink topic that they can read it provides them with tips so that they don't forget. And it's there's a game that they can play its bingo an at the end of the month. They have questions and they felt their little bingo cards and whoever has their bingo cards filled gets a $25 gift card, so I feel like the Bolton bored was really just a way to positively influence them instead of sitting down and yelling at them or things like that, it kind of gives them a positive way to remember all the things that they're supposed to be doing at the register.	0

Um disclosing information to mean in which? She was struggling with her own health, she was struggling with her own reproductive sexual health. And I was able to give her the advice that she needed.

Hello I think any situation where I was able to positively impact. Others would be when I received my promotion for my last job, I spent 5 years in an accounting firm. He started out as a receptionist up front and then I was promoted to administrative assistant for 2 of our partners at the firm. And I think my addition to the admin team, which consisted of just three other ladies like myself. Was a positive impact not only on the teamwork and helping having an extra set of hands and eyes and ears and. And. Something you contribute to the team on. Also, it helps are. Clients you be able to have more people to be in contact with partners to be able to reach out to somebody. Out for the day we were all equally trained on the same thing, so if somebody without I would be able to help. Out there partner vice versa. If I was out to be able to be able to help them. I think my addition to the team. Also helps with the Fluidity and professionalism with the administration team that takes care of most of busy work. Not to mention most of the customer service basis clients so I would definitely say that. Heading that passed on to me to be able to be apart of such tilmann positively influencing not only that. Results in Just an extra boost to the team and then our firm in general.	0
At my last job my. Coworker was having a difficult time with a client. And so I was able to step in and calmly talk to the client that was having the issue. And Uhm. Make a situation OK for them, so they ended up having a positive experience at the end of everything. And then my coworker was extremely grateful that I was able to come in. They were a little bit newer on the job. And not as seasoned in dealing with people that weren't necessarily happy with the service that they are receiving. So they were able to listen to my feedback and realize how and future, they would be able to handle the situation a little bit better. Be a little bit calmer house, a little bit more of a positive attitude and deflect the situation before it was able to escalate. And I think everyone at the end of that came out feeling better and more positive and happier than when they started.	0
So when it comes to a situation that I honestly take on the daily if I'm one of those people that really believed. Leading by example is really, truly what's gonna make a difference is actually going to show people like if you're serious and if you're actually. Walking talking about here appeared decision. So I mean, any situation that comes about even if it's just by meeting a new friend. Or by just saying hello or good evening or whatever it is because I am a person that is a part of him sociation that truly believes in leadership for the future of tomorrow. We do practice in Excel and just basically being human to going back to our roots and without dollar that technology is being distracted. You know within the County battle of if I'm good enough if anything being confident in being a person walking talking about so there. That I just showed another person here and now I'm a human just like you and I truly do. Want to be genuinely interested in you as a person. So we can grow together so we can leave together so we can just strive. To be the best person that we can be so of course, the situation mean when I'm actually coaching and training other people that I've met you. So I mean to you am I always out in front you know when it comes to note shows whole networking events. When it comes to just work in general or when it comes to just going through the park. I am most definitely someone that needs my examples. Taking that Walker see an just knowing that everything is gonna be OK. No matter what you know, sometimes you get this. Butterflies in your stomach like Oh my gosh. I'm doing this, but it's like once you do it, you realize man. It was so fulfilling man it was so rewarding or maybe? You know it might not be the best experience which what was it that I got to learn out of that. Situations that made me a better person that's going to make me the best person that I can be. 5 years ago from the in game so that is something that I would most definitely would say that. Situation that I actually left by examples and just truly believe that it will make a difference.	1

I'm fine when I was able to positively influence the action of others actually occured when I was working customer service. Over the Phone. For an advertising company. Basically my job was to be the supervisor for the supervisors. So I took. Phone calls from agents who had already taken supervisor Phone calls from other clients on the floor. So I was kind of like the last resort. Before we actually had to get management involved. This particular instance involved legal matters. On bankruptcy I was working mortgage loans at the time and I specifically in the mortgage Department so are. We basically had your body by government laws and regulations the entire time. What happened why is one of our? Cutler's lawyers had called anything that they were constantly being harassed. Sign company and another person's debt has been discharged in bankruptcy and that we use to stop otherwise do these things in my record. Long story short. We need I found out that we were coding. The system incorrectly and that we had to basically retrain everybody on the floor and figure out the proper coding. I'm hearing. My team was initially very hesitant because it's not what they were originally taught and they didn't believe that. Changing my specific coding would zombie issue, but it's in. In fact, and it took me being positive and upbeat. And reassuring my team to get them to be harboring about the change because they weren't used to change. And in reality changes something we have to deal with every single day, so having that be positive attitude. Really helps probably influence then change their mind and to do the proper process that we learned. Would fix the issue.	1

An it would would really bring down the rest of the team, there were a group of 4 of us. As I was the leader of the group. I was able to kind of control the situation by redirecting. And pointing to some more positive things that were happening for example, she was very upset about a change in our. In the program that we were using things where I'm moving as slowly as things were moving as quickly as you wanted. And I was able to say you know this is the best time to rest we get to provide feedback. With this new system. And. We're really in control of the situation so let's brainstorm and come up with you know ways to make things better. So instead of the complaining. We were all able to come to brainstorm and of course, there was some complaining to to determine that the issues in the concerns. But we were eventually able to come up with some ideas that really ended up being very helpful for the program that we? You know we're trying to perfect. So. I was able to kind of fear the group in a different. Direction. 2. To positively come up with something that that actually helped us when we were able to implement those changes to the program, which ended up. Making our jobs a lot smoother, so instead of just getting into the system of activity and just cycling through all that we were actually able to. To make a difference. And. End up making our jobs, even easier just by taking a step back and redirecting in a more positive way.	0

She was about to Mister Flag and she had a very important situation to cancel. For family passed away and there was nothing multiplied for that thing the fibers already almost closing and I. This is for that person with the constant of my supervisors to get to that slide so they could make it on time. I'll go above and beyond, to do what I did for that individual thinking it could have been myself.	0
I have to say with my most previous job, I was in charge of coming up with the monthly and weekly. Freezer door closed just to encourage other agents on the floor. You know to be encouraged into you know keep pressing. And still I believe that just being in that position is enabled me to positively given that push or. The simple words to you know push them to keep going on and so I was very proud of that and I became very influential. In that you know position to the point where aside from that, we would just come together to have a small group such as smallpox. Every at the end of every week and so yes, except my most influential. Reflect that I have. My previous employer.	1
It would have to be when I am a teacher. We had to put up these boards for the pictures of the children. We had done each take a picture of different facial expressions. Happy sad angry or silly and doing this we all contributors different idea in. Our school wants to do an idea of inquiring environment things so we twined the words like we had the words in. And we have the munchies, then your private in the black parts an we had I had the idea of. Whining the paper it through and then she just loved that idea so much that they were like we have to do this. So our board had the name twined in between. And their facial expressions. So you have to flip it over and see which facial expressions there was. And the teachers love the idea of gas which facial expression. We doing instead of having it clearly labeled. It would be like a little guessing game. Each pair then kid anyone who came through with gas and I thought that was a great idea. An order teachers were completely on board with it.	1
The way I was able to positively help. Others was we have in banking, there is a lot of changes that go on. In most companies that's true but in this case with banking it. It changes all the time. In this case, we have a new system that we call the CLS system. An it's a tracking system, where we have an issue with a loan booking or any type of loan issues. Again, we are able to send it oufan I was part of the team to kind of create that. And, of course, anything that comes out new there is always hiccups, but after the first couple of months. It has definitely helped out a lot of people and it's a good training for the individual that actually takes on the new process. And it will be even better as time progresses to get things done more efficiently effectively and will help our clients. To make them happy, so when there is a mistake. They may not know about it, and were able to fix it behind the scenes. Without the compliant even knowing so that was a good thing that I think we were able to do with bank.	0
A situation that I was able to positively influence the actions of others. As definitely then. A lot of the last 2 years after I've gotten back from Rwanda. I was able to study a lot in Rwanda related to the Post Genocide Restoration Peacebuilding. That, they did their and their use of the traditional court system. So I was able to bring that knowledge back here to America with me since I've returned. And help other people understand the current propaganda going on politically as well as greater. Inclusivity of others. And greater understanding of people that they don't know or customs and religions that they don't know. And. Everything around that it's been huge last couple years to be able to use that knowledge. Back here to try and help with peacebuilding in our own countries since our social cohesion. Is there a little while Rwanda social cohesion? As of 2015 was at about 95%? So there have been numerous situations that I have been able to positively influence the actions of others. Based on that.	1
I'm very positive person so I'm always trying to find. I did everything that happened. So any problems they asking about it like positively influence the actions of others. I don't have like a specific situation. One ring I like the most recent one with it, then it comes at. Negative for a client and the bank where I work. We find solutions to positive solutions to accommodate the client and we were able to retain their client app on demand. At the situation was negative, but we were able to find different solutions and I was very excited that we were able to. Keep the client and they were happy that I was able to assist them. An aggressively. And that's what I do on a day-to-day basis with all my clients.	0
Well, there was a situation while working on a normal healthy and it as a nurse. Where there was a patient who had just come on to the unit and she was? Not there by choice, she came in kicking and screaming and she was. Clearly very scared to be there and. A lot of my coworkers responded to the situation with exasperation 'cause that is something that we see quite often on the mental health unit people that. After in such ways, but I tried my best to treat the patient as an individual, not just another one patient who acted that way. An I you know talked to her in a calming manner, an I told her that she is safe. And I've tried to do everything I could to make her comfortable even when she was screaming at me, I got her extra pillows. I got her water. And I got her situated into a room, which is not common practice usually we doing assessment in it. Medical examination room, impatient there admitted but I knew that would make her even more uncomfortable so I took her straight to her room. And it actually did work out very well after I got on her level. I don't try and talk to her in that calming and therapeutic manner, she was able to come down. Without the use of medication, which my Co workers were preparing to give her I always think that it's good, too. Tell you help people without medication 'cause it doesn't really. Get to the root of the issue. It's much better to just talk to them and try to resolve the situation in that manner so. I was able to positively influence that patient stay on the unit.	1

Comfortable with and I went ahead and I help them learn how to do what they needed to do on. The program and the computer and everything to get their job done. Better timely fashion, so they in turn, helped me on other things, so it was kind of like A. Basically, a team effort, but yeah, that is one situation to where I was positive and I kept.

Another positive one was when I worked at and I'll go and I had to deal with a customer. And it was a way of getting getting to know that customer, but giving them the positive way of saying like they would actually questions like deep questions and. It would it would honestly make me feel good about myself to know that they actually trust me to give them. You know. Like an answer to it and a positive. Outcome was that was that they actually came to me and it was a great way to get to know them. From when I would give our positive action to others. It would be with young girls young teens and. One of them was when I girl came to me and she was pretty hope like didn't know what to do in her situation with her mom. So I would talk to her and just give her the benefit of the doubt that everything was gonna be OK and that no. That things happen for a reason.	1

Could really change the mood and you know the setting around an environment?	1

In my current role as a branch manager on something that is very important to me and specially in my role. Is our? Annual Arts and for our annual audits are team members are expected to know a set of questions and. Know the answers for them or at least how to find the answers. So my idea around that to help our team members have a better understanding of the questions and just be able to perform. Better under the microscope are in our audit day was to breakdown. The set of questions and have our team members partner up. So at first my team was kind of like this isn't what we normally do this isn't how we normally study for our annual audit. So you know, I had to present it to them in a manner that they understood that this is a different way because our audit. Technique has changed 100% this year, the expectations are very different from the years previous so we did try. Our new message and it was able to help us grow together as a team and further our knowledge. In our audit procedures so with That being said in the end, it resulted in us getting a really, really high passing score for our annual audit.	1

So. And time where I was able to positively influence the actions of other I currently work in HR right now. In working in a jar, you come in you do work with lots of people lots of different backgrounds. Lots of different situations. I mean, one of the Times that I would say is positive that I influenced we have a tremendous amount. Love. Benefits in our Department and the one thing that our HR director. He was not aware of was all of the benefits that we have available. So what I did was created a document spreadsheet lining out all of the benefits that we had in the positive. The reasons why people should sign it, sort of different businesses are the different socks and things that we had around there. And how it would not only affect people positively when they decided to leave the company, it would also allow them to Celine. Belonging to the company and not just being a body there, they were invested. So with your company. Are they still is not my family. They felt like they were a part of something so I was able to help our HR director, too. Be able to relate to the people that he was hiring. All of the positive benefits, said the citizens would be able to tap into by working. Within this ability that we work with and had. We not take the time to make things easier for them to recognize. I don't think that we would have to buy in that we have right now with the different insurances software programs that we have.	0

Didn't have any structure even though it wasn't the manager even one of the companies they will follow my lead. Follow my example about how to protect the security guards and go above and beyond. There will be situations where. You know, people will come in for wedding anniversary's in birthdays and nobody would send up amenities so I would. Initiative to bring up amenities to people who were there, setting celebrating special occasions and I will be recognized on supervisor at least. Every day or every other day and the staff got on board and started following my League. An we went from. I believe like 58 winter divisor to at least. 28 by the time that I left the company at you know the last hotel. I was at in. Even at one time right now, the Elan. So.

An and they appreciated that they appreciate me sort of talking them off the ledge and we went to our trainers. As a group and said this is what we need to succeed in this role to be better employees. To be better case managers to our members and they appreciated us doing that, and training went smoothly from that and.

Our captain is out girls we cannot let this affect us. We are one strong team and we can do this we can be 15 we can play stronger and harder. I could see that we are, and we got back out in the court and we all played well together again. We did end up winning but it was a close game.

I came in and I was his medical assistant that day. He was not a happy camper, he was you know a little grumpy and it was his first time. With us in our practice and I felt like it was my responsibility to change his perspective. He wasn't too happy with an experience that he had previously at another dermatology practice. So I took it upon myself and into my own hands to make sure that when he left that day, he left. You know feeling much, much better than the way he? Felt when he first got there, so he was there because he needed a surgical procedure to remove a skin cancer. And, of course, who you know who wants that so you know, he was until happy, but I took it upon myself and I.

I was able to turn. Apparent that came very frustrated for maybe a situation that wasn't my fault or the company couldn't really handle or deal with. With the way I handled it was always smiling and making sure that they know their kids always come first when it comes to taking care of them. And yeah, so with the way I was being positive. That made the parent change the way that they were in also. Be more in a positive mood and everywhere. I go I get told that I bring smiles behind me so. No matter where I go?

Not his and hopefully he will sign another position and I hope I helped in some way.	0
There so my name is David and one or a time where I positively influence the actions of others. So I still got 5 years working in the restaurant industry. I absolutely loved it 'cause just it was high energy I got to. Interact with people but we were one of the busiest stores in our district and so with that territory coming along. Periods of huge rushes and lots of customers they can get really overwhelming and so I always just try to keep. A really positive spirit when things were crazy, and so I would like to think that not only my positive spirit. But my work I think of making sure everything was being done correctly and in the mayor should be. To ensure that we didn't make any mistakes and cause more problems, but just to keep the pace moving. And to just always be complementing other people and I feel like my insistence on keeping the work environment positive. Help my coworkers stay positive and thus also have our customers have a? Positive experiences.	1

A situation that comes to mind that I was able to influence the action of others is when I was a manager of a front desk at a spa. We had uh. Team works at issue that came about. We had somebody transfer over and the team wasn't too fond of the individual that came to manage with me. Because we were in We were in expanding just like frontier is currently. So what I did was I actually sat down, then you manage are and my employees and I touched base on what could. Uh what could be done and what the issues are and how we could resolve it. So once we got the whole crew together, the whole team together, we sat down, we actually confronted our issues. And we came to a conclusion. We we wanted everybody to have respect for management and management that have respect for anyone because then and then the? Relationship that's always mutual so we confronted the issues that we had at one of the main issues was management came in and started dictating everyone. And that was not me. Of course I I prefer servant leadership, I like to. To go through the dirt with my with my team rather than tell him to do it by themselves because that's just my. Management style, however, some people like to dictate situations as their stuff. So basically just came to the conclusion that works for everyone. And getting the team to sit together and actually confront the issues work best when it came to resolving the issues so that would be. That would be my answer to that question.	0

I have to pick up my daughter, which is understandable, the line is long. You have somewhere to be.

As I was able to positively influence the actions of others was when I was a flight attendant for Sun Country Airlines. And I had a Decapitated passenger D capacitate? Are deep seated passengers. On my flight and it happened during boarding when you're on the ground in JFK airport. The situation was that there was a passenger that looked like she was ill. And she sat down in her seat and there were. Customers around her that we're noticing that she was. Unresponsive I was in the back alley and I had noticed everyone kind of looking at her funny. So I ran up. To her quickly and I sent her an WE? Figured out that she was unresponsive. And so I quickly got an able bodied person. To lift her up to the back alley and bring her to the back. For CPR I immediately thought the CPR going and I got the Ed out and the lead flight attendant. Associated over the intercom asking if there was any nurses any doctors on the flight and. We ought to work. We were. Doing CPR for quite a while, it was about 45 minutes until the. Paramedics came so it was an unfortunate circumstance because we did the best we could however. I believe in that situation, I took initiative action and. I got everyone to get involved in. Be part of this situation and even though it ended up not. Having a way that we wanted. We still I still demonstrated that I could possibly take action. Thank you.	1

My parents, who always African they don't necessarily know a lot about the American culture, the marking web like. Hum how to even right and so they were in a situation where they needed to learn how to read and write from scratch. For the sake of passengers citizenship exams and with that came a lot of confusion and they were really scared and nervous to begin. And the actual process, but I understood this situation given that I just recently graduated from college. I took the time. And the necessary steps to be able to influence him into the right direction as to why I was cleaning the American citizenship would be such a fantastic and a wonderful opportunity for them. Are they were able to pick up reading and writing from scratch as well. And I'm thankful to say that they were able to pass their citizenship exam. It was a decision that they weren't too comfortable with because they're always teaching me and they're always. How do you work this thing to do so I think for them to start a little weird to sort of have that one way relationships just did a little bit. But it was a situation that I knew I needed to take action. It was my parents, who I love dearly and I had the educational background to be able to teach them. And it was such a positive experience for me just being able to teach my parent, I read and why. English and thankfully now my American home is not their home and they have to stability of being able to stay here, so. That was definitely a situation where I was able to influence them in sort of nudged him in the right direction and it's not fantastic. I am I hold him dearly and I know that the people go. They just didn't have the time. No, but it's not acting like capable individuals and buying how to read and write.	1

A situation where? I'm encouraged others for a positive. And. And. I will say working when they in the hospital. I remember seeing this patient that he is all education. The homeless and he was being sick an alarm 1/4. You don't want to pros and maybe because of the way he looks. And he was a smelly that well so I didn't matter. I I approached him and I tried to to help him. Ann. Or at the end of the day, I think one of my coworkers sold my activity to let him tell him. You made them feel like. I leave it as it is sad within itself because they were saying that there was a nice gesture. That sometimes we shooting huge or criticize or apart people. 20 for the operators on the way they look or. Can we I don't know we really don't know, and how the journey. Everybody is going through it, so I always try to to be firmly. Help. And be able to do my part in every single thing that I do every day. So I think that they give them a. Maybe. I showed him that sometimes. Being kind is not that difficult and at the end, the joy. Allergy and enjoy we can have together. There. Is?	0
I guess when you see a situation is. You know despite. Customers. Get upstairs. A coworker seeing that no matter what. I keep my cool. And if I don't get too many wanna know how to do that.

One example that I had to do a positive impact with others is when I was working at their front doors at the ticket counter for frontier. And this one particular passenger was not able to travel because her father was missing for more than 24 hours. And so I just coached her an calmed her down, and was able to influence her that now would not be the best time to travel. There she should really find out about the safety of her father, she end up flying out the next day and bought me some Flowers to thank me.	0
A way that I was able to actually help someone in to influence their actions within a situation where I've worked as a school counselor as well as I work for a travel agency currently. And working for during big RV rental company, I had a client that came in as she was she was very. Excited to take out the items to the point that she wasn't willing to actually fill out the paperwork. And what I did was I had to talk to her cousin or a little bit more, but moved in it. Expedite leeway so that she was able to not miss her opportunities for her flight so in that case. I believe it actually was taken was that I was able to calm the situation have her to fill out the proper paperwork. And the result, she came out of a happy camper. Also, she was the result is this is A5 Car Company. A review is stated that provided her with excellent customer service, she would highly recommend a company and she would.

Spell hideously at my job at although I'm working in retail. I had a customer who came in and it was.

Now, during this process, I listened to the customer allow her to go ahead and express herself well explained her that I do understand her concerns. And also informing her that I will do anything at that point to rectify the situation for her. And so moving forward what I did do is. Let her know that Unfortunately without a bill because she would come with receipt and wanted a refund. I approach is that it is company policy too. Not go ahead and just. Refund. Without a receipt, however. I did get her a store credit. And based on that I felt like it was a win win situation, she left extremely satisfied happy. And I believe that that. Explained it too serious for positive customer service. And as soon as the customer to be happy and leave happy as well.	1
When I was at my former job of Wawa Incorporated, which is a company in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Florida. And those 3 states only I was a manager at the time and I had a couple of duties too. I tend to when I was with my coworkers. I had instructed them to do certain tasks that I know that each in it. Then would very much enjoy. I understand that certain working forget and not every employee will be very happy with all of the tasks that need to accomplish. But I had rewarded them with food and soda afterwards, which is something that a lot of people enjoying. They very much. Appreciated my work ethic and had also thanked me afterwards for letting them do the position that they do. Most enjoy when they're at work. I very much enjoy having my employees happy because when you have it happy employees. Or tends to get done and it gets done in a better way if you were not giving your employees. A very good. Deal or having them work together in a happy work environment a lot of employees won't work as hard. And to the best of their abilities going above and beyond is always the answer for me at work. And I am at work I always try to get the most amount of work done at work shift. And even as that entitles me to stay after work I'm very OK with that. That's very easy option for me to do. Is being at work a little later is always the best option rather than leaving and not having old tasks done? When those actions were done by the other employees it positively did affect them, because I couldn't instructed him to do something they did not like. Instead, I chose to give them tasks that I know that they thoroughly enjoy throughout their work shift.	0

So the question was to describe a situation in which I was able to positively influence the actions of others. First of all a lot of my answers are going to be airline story related 'cause I'm. Been flying for 2014. Hum. So my first thought was. Back at my former airline when we Merged a Airbus Fleet with Boeing Fleet. I was trained on Airbus then I really prefer air brass. But I knew that I had to. Be comfortable working on either aircraft. So as soon as uh. That merger happened between the two work groups that we're applying through those aircraft. A lot of people started bidding trip specifically for the type of airplane. And I did the opposite. Either do not look or if there was a choice between Airbus or Boeing. I selected Boeing on purpose. The first couple of times so I can get familiar with that. And then when I talk to my classmate, so that we're still close and. Other people are falling within told them that that kind of inspired I was told that a couple of felt inspired him I could do it. Mission 2.	1

You can't have it up there for certain reasons Aaron. She was like why an art older and they told her that you can head up there. It's first come first serve. But if you like I can see if I can put down in the cargo. Ben's an? Be able for you to get it right back as soon as you go. To really destination is and she's like OK. That's a lot better, she seem more happier and. Came out good. So. I didn't have anymore issues. Afterwards so the slides and it was also nice since she was smiling like I was smiling and we had fun. So I'm good time out of a bad situation. All right.	0

So, but everyone does it need anything so I'm always there will be results, like? It'll be over soon and kind of time, calling people down and at the end of that everybody's right. You know. And everybody turned it from a better mood. You know, kind of laugh at all likely not let's just hope for any reason. I really do not let me know the workplace much better place to work.	1

So what I did so the situation was that I'm a food and beverage supervisor for the hotel. I work at. I'm in charge of like the whole food and Beverage Department. So I manage the team and there was a situation where? To come. Team members were not agreeing they were kind of having little disagreements and always bickering and they really took a toll on the whole Department. So one time when when there was practice going on. They both kind of started going, adding an I didn't want that to keep going so. Once practice ended I stopped everything I called Hey. My my goal was really to resolve that situation so I put. Pull them aside, both of them to the onto the meeting space. At least at the hotel has and I just talked to them and I just wanted both to kinda. Be able to express themselves in the state environment where it was only them to it wasn't with everybody else. Where other people's ideas and influences could affect them, so I wanted them to feel safe and comfortable being able to talk to each other. And they were both expressing about how they just didn't agree with somebody doing this and they are they all had a different. Perspective in it, so my goal really was to really change that and to really help them kind of work together and kind of. Point that each other has so at the end of the day, we did kind of squashed everything that they both had I was a mediator. Who was trying to just help them and be able to end of the Department and it really has changed the Department a lot since then. So I'm very, very proud about that. But I'm now based they have so much more room to still grow I think. But now they work so much better with each other and more as a team.	1

She was not only pleased with the local goodwill. But she was also pleased with our company so the action that. I took provided her with a positive of with the possible outcome, she was very excited with this item. Getting removed and in the end result was she gave my office, a call. She told my supervisor how you later. She was that I was late. I went above and beyond, to help her.

So the first time that I can think of that I possibly influence the action of others would probably be my freshman year college on my basketball team and that year. They did a lot of recruiting which something that's cool normally isn't the best that and so we had a lot more talent than was expected an with talent, a lot of the time comes egos and I was one of the only there are 2 freshmen on the basketball team and I was one of them and all through the year. It was a challenge trying to get these guys work together. But one thing my coach had me do partly because I wasn't in a position to threaten anyone else is playing time as I was kind of a blue guy in terms of getting People to work together and talk to one another and not be upset with each other. I was kind of the mediator, a lot of the time so I was only playing for 5 minutes again, which definitely allowed me to have a positive influence and not have People feel threatened by my presence. So I was definitely in a good position for it and you know just being on the basketball team. There's a lot of factors that go into being successful and that year was the first team or first time we made it to the playoffs in school history. An was very fortunate enough to be a part of it, but not only that I just feel like I was able to make some really, really good friends and really great connections with People. And that taught Maine, you know just how complicated things can be when People are working on a team 'cause. There's so many different. He goes that you have to manage and things that People like the way that they enjoy being talked to versus how they don't enjoy being talked to you have to know how to communicate with others and get the best out of them because if you're just berating someone, it might push them into a whole as opposed to bring them up and making them more successful.	0

Just called situations for children have to deal with. Give me the opportunity to be able to be a positive influence and you know get to encourage them to do the right thing. We have a lot of violence in the area where I was teaching and. It was very difficult for the kids because that's what they knew how to do when someone did something to them or said something mean? Their first reaction was to be need back, which use violence back and hit someone to punch someone or say something mean? So really gave me the opportunity to be able to influence them to use words nice work kind words explain to someone. Why you're hurt by what they said someone says your stupid? How does that make you feel don't play more you're stupid back? Because that really gets you nowhere in life, it's kind of. Not a good outcome when you use violence and fight fire with fire so I try to teach them. How to express' themselves and how to walk away from situations and you don't like the ceiling fan you feel like it's going down a negative Rd. Walk away. So it really was great to be able to see the kids start to use that when they saw me using it. They started to use it in this very interesting and positive for me to see. Then use when I use in my strategies when I taught them in real life and it was very inspiring to see. May be able to influence these students in a positive way.	1

So I positively influenced others. It was winter than it was the delayed flight hold course. We had some people that weren't very happy with the situation. I was up front, so I was in charge of all pays and making sure that everybody is comfortable. And created them when I come on the plane so when you come on the plane when you have a smile on your face. It's kind of helpful. 2. See someone that is happy and excited to have you on the flight even though you know you're going to be running behind so? What we did is we had everybody sit down we told him? How long delays going to be that we knew of. And make sure we hit up snack. I make sure the TV for on so that they had entertainment while we were sitting. I checked on everyone throughout the flight. I kind of kept up the rest of the crew because we knew we were going in for a long flight it was a 4 hour flight. On Top of it, so we won't be getting until really late. But I mean, sure everybody was real peppy and excited. And by the time we landed we had turned everybody's fine upside down.

I think if I'm listening and you know, explaining situations to whether it be a coworker or to a client. You can get your message across and have a? Positive outcomes where I have done that on many retail. Situations as well as in my custom interior design business where. A building situation did not go as planned. Not only do you payment in a more positive light? But you resolve any situation that may be less desirable. I don't know it comes always look for the brighter situation an work positively to get that through.	0
So a situation in which I was able to positively influence actions of others. I could make a few situations. One being on the smaller scale. I used to work in retail banking and our company kind of had some. Cut back on the budget and we used to have a lot of complementary items for customers and I took it upon myself to. Just head to the dollar store and pick up some Dollar Tree items that I could just continue to provide kind of a? Complementary little snack or little piece of candy for at least the kids that would come into the branch and that would always look forward to just grabbing a sucker when their parents were. I'm getting their banking transactions done and that sits on the smaller scale is being on I would think another. Actuation. I was able to positively influence the actions of my employees my coworkers and. I like to be able to present a lot of customers options so that they don't feel like they are. Pointed sometimes and so and sharing that piece of information in kind of a startup meeting at the beginning of the day. We kind of implemented it throughout the work day, and it was a very positive influence on the customers. Experience at the branch so just a couple of ways that I was able to influence the actions of others. Probably.	1
I think every day is an opportunity to influence the actions of others positively just today at work. We were helping customer who? Ended up buying I don't know if you got it right rather than as you're watching us. But I do work in retail environment right now, so every day you're dealing with customers. You're doing different personalities of the people that work there as well as customers that are coming in today. The customer that was in spending a lot a lot of money and needing a lot of the systems. They had a new sales associate that was helping her who was doing a fantastic job. I was kind of behind the scenes supporting her another one of our associates, who is very. Specific about how things work and how we maintain our standards, but it's really more important to be helping a customer was upset. Or she was pulling flutters out and things were getting busted in math. She's like Oh with her, she knew she just left. Such a math? Why does she always leaves such a marathon? Running late, she ended up with a $1500 sale, so the message doesn't was easily. So later on, so I said, Well, you know, she's helping her with the cell we can straighten up. It's written this up and really the kind of just turn her thought process around it. Yes, it's really needs to look good, but the priority is to help the customers and sell merchandise. And I'm sorry to worry about this letter stating facts and this New Girl was doing a really good job. Of running around and she just needed back support to help her figure out where things were in what you do. So I hope I mean, she was positive because other people in store that were so pleased with her. Stop doing leaving message behind her. She really misses doing the best. She could I tried to get them to realize that we could be her back support instead of. Telling her that she wasn't doing a good job or leaving a mess in that that was the priority to probably really wants to help. Customer at that moment.	0

Basically always ensure that we delivered above the expectation of what a classroom setting should be like, we frequently sometimes an instructor might be. For example, an instructor might be burnt out or have a difficult student and felt like their methods of studying with the student were not fulfilling the outcome that they wanted. One of the things that I constantly employed as a manager of the instructors was to sit down with them and try to get to the. Root of where the actual frustration was as opposed to blaming it on a student then we would work through some of the concrete. Effective methods that allowed us to succeed in the past and usually be able to overcome the obstacle. To help the student achieve the success that they needed.	1

I had a situation that I have to help my other coworker during the. They probably have the first thing that it was is. My coworker has a problem, he didn't understand how to approach the situation and this is what the time. Of the It was an escalation. And custom was yelling and the agent care very frustrating and he stopped crying So what I did is I went ahead and say, well. You know pause. And I breathe slowly. And take a few minutes and then I can go back and get understanding what the customer is asking. I don't understand this minute and then once you understand but do not talk over the customer because. You just be an escalating the situation so listen first asking hard to find out exactly Wat customer needs. Asking. Why is talking to you right now? He has to have a problem in order for him to be talking to you right now, so once you listen. And then possibly be able to answer. Quietly without him to be upset. But if you answer why he's talking I think it could be a reason. I think a few minutes, Grace just one second, three and you can go back and you answer the question. And that's what I did so and he did that and the customer was coming because it's getting out. Because he was talking over over customer so and that's what happened. And so.	0
I time I had to, I can positively influence. Others was when I was working at Universal Studios on.

I start influencing them to act the way I was to turn the situation around to make it a better situation. Into practically com people and get everybody out safely and quickly as possible so that way we can deescalate. The situation is happening inside.	0

So if we're talking about influencing the actions servers have taken in a positive way I would say that. When I worked at Disneyland Paris. We had a lot of opportunities working with a lot of foreign nationalities, all from around mainland Europe. An England United Kingdom Island scotlands, etc. And so when you talk about the influences I would say there's been sometimes where. Catherine that I've worked with haven't been corresponding to what we were supposed to be doing so in order to? To rectify the situation and just I have no authority when I was at least in Paris. We all equal we will not. Leaders and managers be working together, so to pull someone aside and tell them that you know you have to do it this way. This is going to be the most beneficial way. You and you're going to thank me in the future because this is the easiest way and it works effectively. It has a good outcome, so you can tell guests. One thing you could tell cast members another thing. So when we have lines for save Rapunzel or married or Mickey Mouse. People were trying to squeeze in many people in as they could and you just have to tell them that. It's not the right way to do it 'cause it's more efficient you could have. I sent line of people move them forward and then they leave, and then cast members who knew would understand that. It's not a rush job. It's more of a show job so it works, effectively so cast members are always happy to have. The positive quizzes Christmas systems excuse me so I feel like that was a good way to influence people in a non. Oh, sorry Safeway so. Just give him advice push them forward and help him succeed in their career within the company that I work for which was Disney.	1

I got work in a newsroom environment and that can be very stressful environment fast changing. We have a situation one day where like 3 or 4 of our Top stories. What was going to be the first 15 minutes of our. Show fell through at the very last minute. It was very stressful situation. We're probably about 30 minutes to the Top of the show. Any knee jerk reaction from a lot of the team was to sort of give up and to let. Things go up in flames as. Sort of invisible consequences to the rest of the team of what happens when. They fall through and their commitments. What I suggested instead where that we pick up the slack today? And talk tomorrow about how we could do things better, we did. We all jumped inwardly recruit other people. To get contact turned quickly an make the Top of the show, something that was worthwhile for the viewers to watch. It happens very fast, it requires a lot of teamwork, but we were able to get it done. And what resulted was a quality product. Day off. An inability for us to talk to the team members who had not fulfilled their commitments. About why it is not a desirable situation for anyone to be in because we weren't able to deliver. The kind of quality product, we wanted. It was prime product, but not the kind we wanted.

I would take time for like God in my thoughts and then I would go to the person. An explains them kindly of course, and just to give them a little bit of perspective an mostly and generally speaking. The people are very much happier with the way I tell them and they're happier with having that perspective annoying.

A situation in which I was able to influence. Others would be back when I was in college. I was in public. Speaking class and we had to do a title that was. A Riddle. Risking. It was about sweatshops and um appan doing my. Review and research of the topic, I found out that a lot of the. A lot of the clothing that I wore. Um had a lot of sweat shops shops in 3rd world countries so at first my teammates were a little apprehensive about it. But I you know went right into the books started working and I. Found out you know a lot of information the background and would have you and how much it costs are survive. Again today in the 3rd World Countries, an although it was a risky topic showing the enthusiastic to Susie Asom excuse me. 2. Oh, and not influenced but um results are other classmates and and educate them on this situation got my other teammates into it.

Ann. Describe a situation where I was you were able to positively influence the actions of others OK. It was a time that I was actually on a flight when I was a previous flight attendant and. There was a passenger excuse me, who was on the flight. And it was during boarding an one of my coworkers actually asked the members that passenger excuse me to sit down. She was a little upset that she asked him to sit down but it was raining boarding process. So once we got up and he sat down once. We were up in the air. He had gotten up again and go to the restroom. And he wanted you know, he wanted to make sure he was a little very friendly and she asked him to sit down and King. And then I could tell you whether to her before I went to him as I was taking them. Orders I asked him would be OK. He said he wasn't 'cause he wasn't too pleased that my coworker.

And. So I think a way to positively influence the actions of others is through communication number one listening to what? There needs maybe an acting on that, especially in customer service. And. Trying to effectively listen to what exactly it is that they need and being able to not only meet their expectations. Trying to go above and Beyond and I think an example is when I've done that would be. Hum. When I flew last. Ann. I would say. Having a minor child on there that isn't flying with their with their parents and being able to. Keep them safe. Or being able to calm someone down. When they're really anxious. Ann. I would say positively effects. Their actions for being able to calm someone down that's angry and trying to tell you what, exactly it is that they weren't being able to listen and to be able to. Communicate effectively. Ann. What exactly the solution is?	1

I would say that I was able to possibly influence others. In a situation where I was new to the team and they were working for a very long time on a project. But they were just really going downhill they lost all motivation. And then I came in. And I didn't have any of that stress on me, I didn't have any of that anxiety or kind of. A cloud of failure and so I just kind of sent them up and said listen guys. We need to get our heads around this. And I was able to positively influence them into actually winning the project that they were stuck on and so sometimes you just need a fresh pair of eyes. Somebody from outside the box. And and you know what it turned out really well for them and I was very proud of them. That was able to to help him that way. They just needed some motivation from somebody that was just. Outsider box really.	0

Choose to go door to door times, so a lot. There was very limited limited amount of women they used to be. At our company and the woman over there used to be very afraid of getting to go out there. Can meet people door to door and really just put themselves out there? I'm so me being that I've always been outspoken and I've never been afraid to step up and trying things. I decided to start going by myself, You know before the rest of the girls fit and I began to give them that model. And show them that look we can do this like yeah, we're girls and yeah, I know you're afraid of. What the possibilities of what can happen, but you know what can happen if we? How do we know what's gonna happen if we don't? Get out there and at least try so I was able to show these girls that by going out there and putting myself out there and getting it done. They can do it, too, and soon enough deferral started getting out there and doing their jobs, too. And they started getting great at it and they started to like it. Next thing you know they started getting people fighting up with us and a lot of people started getting the fiber optics with AT&T. And if you know if I didn't get bowling put myself out there and try to create myself as this role model for these other women. Who knows if they would have followed in my footsteps and I've been as successful as they are today? You know, I don't like to brag and say that you know it's because of me, but you know. These girls were afraid at some point and I am glad that I was a part of getting to help them out and get them out of their shells.	1
It turned out was able to positively influence. Others around me was when I was stationed up in Minnesota for my service in the United States military. It was sort of a cold day and by cold than it was super cold in the fact that it was about 20 below. Nearest snow everywhere and remember, it's just not having a good time, we had some training to do, we're cold we retire we're hungry? But I was able to do was to take that really just awful day and say, Hey, it's snowing outside. It just means we have better like to do our work. It just means that we're able to not sweat as much work. Just take a positive spin on everything. And ultimately image. Myself and the rest is soldiers go alright. We can make the best verse sure it's cold. But that just means we can wear our warm fuzzy coat and the happy with their and it makes it. Easier to conceal yourself while doing certain sort of tactical maneuvers. Uh. This is one of my favorite times. I was in the military doing tech support movements when. That was The main thing that happened was that I had to listen to all of my other soldiers because I was high ranking them them. I had to listen to their grievances and I had to listen to why they were unhappy and I was also. Able to articulate to them. Hey it's going to be fine. I'll get you some cheerleader a compromise was made. Between myself and my shoulders and it was just a better day for everybody.	1
And a banging away to where I positive positively influence the action of others OK. I remember when I was working at the talk to waiters at Mandalay Bay here in Las Vegas. I had a coworker who at the time was a bar, Porter and had just started with the company and there came up a job bid for a bar back. In in one of the service bars at Mandalay Long story short, he and I were talking and he's just like no. I don't have I don't have the experience and not going to look for you, you have to have you have to know your alcohol. You have to know your poor accounts. You have to know all these things about alcohol food and beverage things like that, So what I did is I told him in a way. They're never going to know if you're interested if you don't sign it, an at least try and we try and see what happens so Long story short. He ended up getting interviews become a bar back which is Mandalay Bay and now to this day. He is a bartender so he started at the bar, Porter became a bar back and now he is one of the long, long, long. So I'm pretty proud of that and hopefully this gentleman remembers that it was just that one conversation that Hey. Where do you try it or not, and you sign this big? There's never going to know if you're fighting and see what happens.	0

Continue to be kind, even if they got passive aggressive or insulting a lot of times it's just refuses to. Continuing to be positive and to not retaliate in that way and. I've seen a lot of people. Turn their attitudes around and I've even gotten apologies from people that were. Just really stressed out and kind of took it out on the flight attendant or the passengers around them, but just.

It was really confusing because there was like a several new features of this, this device. But I think 20 in the cold center with being received the the item on the device itself. Like right away so we had to wait. So what I'm. What we did was take all my coworkers that thought it? And try it out like together in one more breaks. So one person was doing this setup for the device those one trying to see what troubles you can do. Like intentionally intentionally let's do this wrong during the set up to see what we can do.

By the time I was able to positively influence the actions of others when I was a shift leader. Dutch brothers. As well as before, I just waited Dutch brothers I. I was just highly respected in my workplace and. People would come to me with questions as well as. Our concerns that they had about the workplace and stuff like that, they saw me as a trustworthy figure. And would confide in me. So specifically there were times where? We were doing a promotion with an edible glitter that goes into the drinks as crazy as that sounds. And. B. We weren't the training was very minimal on it, it was mostly a memo sent out an. So we had a lot of confusion in the stand about how much put in and. Winter put it in and all that other stuff with drinks put it in. And it could end up pretty bad if it was put into the wrong drink. But I was able to help people that really didn't understand what they were doing too. Alright make sure that they were doing it right and to make sure that customers were getting it right. Which was the biggest priority of that? And once I was able to help probably 5 or 6 people. Learn how to do it, they were able to teach the other people that they worked with and so on, and so forth.	0

Good afternoon my name is Trish to answer your question what comes to mind 1st is being a volunteer at school and having a situation. One day when there was a tornado actually coming through the school, which is what we start that didn't happen, but it happens to be something a teacher is that there's a teacher day volunteered at the school quite a bit. And we were able, I felt like as a teen effort. The teacher and myself were able to influence the children. We were in charge of the 3rd grade class and of course, everyone was scared, including me an including the teacher and we wound up getting older children into the Hall and the positions that we had practice and I feel like. We we went to them to not to worry that it was just a swarm and it was going to go over and we followed protocols that we would be all OK. And yes, we were all OK and the parents were very pleased at the outcome. Once I came to pick up the children of course. They were nervous and deep down, we're all nervous thanks.	0
When I used to work in a pet store in. Homestead often enough, I would influence others into doing some micro workers into doing a door works faster and. Any more organized way, depending on how much soft, we wrote the receiving in the store English we would. Organize it on the Top shelf and when you're organizing in the Top shelves. You need to use the ladder in bringing food bags of over 50 pounds or more up and down the ladder can be actually a little bit tricky. So we would use a buddy system in which we would pass the big bags of food and that helps. Out a lot with accommodating stock and the store a lot faster. And that was the way that I was able to positively influence our store and how we stopped at the store. Itself.	0

I think it's very important to listen to people and to understand where they're coming from and before you. Call you in fact, it for you, trying to influence your question it's kind of interesting with their coming from. So that you know how what was it coming from and that you can kind of understand with their. Problems with situations are sold in the question is how the flags with other people and the answer is that. I have. I'm one time I had people up that we had to do a task that nobody wanted to do. It was to clean a room walls, which worked for her job and I just let everybody know how important was that we get this job done. To make sure you're working with very nice and clean and I also offered to help with it as well, and I need to work with. Alongside the people too.

And I would say. So one situation, I was able to positively influence the actions of others with when I was working for target. Any uh they were under remodel for their store and the store layout was all over the place there was stuff. Everywhere um every night, there was something being moved. And it was a little bit difficult for the associates to kind of manage their aspect and customers and customer service. So. We had to kind of come together as a team, especially maybe couple times a week to come and get things. John and recovered the sales floor and stocking so there was a lot of overwhelming factors that contributed to everybody in the store and getting things done so. I was able to kind of joint everybody in look at things in a different way and. Kind of pride prioritize the time and everything I need to get done tored the end of the night. So we kind of help each other out and. Time managed each others breaks and lunches in a certain way, and it kind of helps each other out. Getting things done when we were under the construction of the story model and. All the situations that were coming into play as far as customers not being happy and some of them that were so it was. Challenging time so I would say. Being positive in management time time management with current how influenced a lot of employees and how we help each other. So that's about it.	0

So today, I work for a regional airline and I feel like a lot of the people on the plane are very stressed out. With traveling so. Instead of them being so stressed out if they're going to make their connecting flight. But I like to do is I like to talk to them and ask him where they're going. And you can make their day by simply may be giving them a snack or helping them put their bag up in the overhead bin Earth. In announcement to help those that do have tight connecting place that they can get off 1st I feel like. One small little thing to help them is what makes them be positive when they got off the plane and then they for sure want to come back. So I feel like those little actions that I do, do help those that. Are having a bad day or are really stressed out?	1
During my time in ABA therapist. There are many times where I could possibly impact, selective another I work with children. And because of that each day was different.

Little boy and what his interests were an applied applied that to my math program for him, he slowly. He came to develop that like in the idea of math and after 3 weeks. It took him now, he loves doing that. He had fun doing it and I think I was really awesome and I hope that he goes places in there. That will be huge in his future.	1
One situation where I positively influenced the actions of others is when I worked at a high school and I influenced. The students there too. Do our job applications to apply to college to fill out their resumes. I help them transition through that process. And. High school students are relatively impressionable so I think telling them about my experiences was one situation where I. Acted in a way that positively benefited them and the response was positive because they came back to me with questions. And really things about application processes so. So that's one situation where I positively influenced others.	0
A situation, which I was able to positively influence the actions of others actually just happened recently I was.

Sony Ericsson that I took to help him with to pour my positive iti on them and help them as best as I could. Is there any task that I could help him to accomplish anything that would make his day easier just? Anything at all to help him out, so that he can feel better about himself positive iti is something that. A lot of people need in their life, sometimes so it's great that I was able to take my positive attitude.

In one of my previous jobs. I was a golf shop attendant, which means that I basically. Posted for golf tournaments. We were very short staffed and it was a very long and early event every time. The last tournament that we had. We. Had a horrible storm in the middle of it was hailing. It was lightning. We had to rush and get everyone off of the? And My 2 coworkers of course were all very overwhelmed with. What's going on and trying to bring everyone in and they were getting very frustrated, which is understandable, but I was quick to remind them that we only had a few hours left at the tournament and if we could just push through. And react to everyone with kindness and understanding knowing that everyone there is going to be stressed over the situation that. Nearly all screwed over quickly. And it did I kind of helped everyone. I guess take on a more positive attitude and kind of just tackle. The situation at hand because it is what it is, and we just had to push through it together. And it worked. We all ended up having a good day and the tournament was able to continue on. Everyone left in. Good spirits for the most part.	0
Hi there, one time when I was able to positively influence the actions of others was actually a time on the plane. I actually have. I don't like this and it now for almost 4 years, so I am familiar with the customer service. Issues that come up on the plane so of course, there was a delay as usual, it was a router. Main things away and we were actually on the tarmac for about 3 hours or at the gate rather. At the gate for about 3 hours before we were able to close the door and get going, and obviously the. Passengers were starting to get antsy. We were communicating every 15 minutes to let them know what was going on. But I tried the best that I could to make it fun and I tried to to just make people feel better in most. Importantly, I tried to make them feel understood. I think one of the best things you can do, especially in the customer. In job is just to make the customer understands that you understand them. I understand your frustrated I understand. That you might miss your next flight, I understand you might be late for a business meeting and I'm sorry. Let me try to make it up to you in whatever way I can control and at that point I could control. Giving people water talking to people talking about different destinations that could go through giving them travel tips and. It actually ended up being one of the best fights. I've ever worked and I I had really good repor. With with the passengers and they really appreciated the fact that we listen to them. We took the time to listen to them and. I actually ended up getting. One of the customers on ended up writing in about us and how how nice the crew was so. Yeah, it ended up being a positive result after what turned out to be a really chaotic start to the flight.	1

Tall girls, but Unfortunately the dress wouldn't fit them completely because it would be a little bit, too, short, but it was system on the body, so sometimes they would be to grab a bigger size. So they could be compliant where it needs to go underneath and then on the body would be a little bit too big. So some of them would give me a little bit of attitude So what I would try to do is. Try to outcome all there, all the obstacles of how they were feeling towards address and how they were looking. And most of the time I would have a positive outcome because I would love to explain to them all the time how important it is compliant. And how they represent the company because uniforms have very important an as flight attendants. They would need to understand that they are the face of the company. So there representing the brand so that is the positive outcome that I would try to always do when I was explaining to them. Why I would do that and how they could later on get it fixed with a Taylor so it would look better on the body and then. It would be always compliant I used to love always working with my different crew members. 2 over always help them and get a positive outcome of it out of every single situation.	1

There isn't a number of times during my role. In which I had developers that would over complicate the needs of the client and that would create things. That would make things difficult for them to complete an one thing that I would always do is always tell them my method of resolving. Issues or solving problems I would always remind them that if you simplify the issue to the smallest amount. To the smallest issue, then you're able to take it head on without being overwhelmed by the number of things you have to do for example. If a developer had to create a proposal if he had to complete the work and if you have to also deliver it to the client. I would tell him to focus on 1st completing the work and then I would assist him with completing the proposals. Or I will show him a template and was to get it done effectively. My methods of working efficiently always kind of made things a little bit easier. For people and I've always tried to always create an atmosphere of less stress and anxiety as possible.	1

And. Always upset when it came to his billing. He wasn't super happy about it just despite the fact that he was. Fully informed about the contract and what it entails on monthly basis any annual fee renewal. So he came in, he was. Super upset really, really loud. And obviously all the other members. Notice.

So uhm when I was about 16 I started working in a hardcore gym hard core is a sport where you do a lot of flips and stuff like this. I've had I had a lot of students come in with really low self esteem you know they weren't. Really involved with a lot of groups at school and um. Too hardcore, I was really able to help them find something that they can progress that make their own and. Made them a little bit more unique you know. And I really watched a lot of students just grow in that aspect of self esteem just. Walking in the first day and having no idea what they're doing, and then through weeks down the line there doing a nice front flip off a box you know. And that's something that can put a lot of confidence into a kid and just someone in general. And so that was one of my favorite aspects of that job was just. Just helping people gain confidence and self esteem was really, really great and. Some of the more specific actions. I took chords doing that. Would be just describing in detail? What they can do to progress their movement. And just helping them really understand that in order to progress it does take. Time, and practice and you're going to mess up and failing is OK. In fact, feeling is I mean that's what you want to do in order to succeed so. You have to fail to get there and helping children learn that is really important, and I really love doing that.	0

So I'm a situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others. I would have to say what the I'm a teacher and parent teacher for a few years now. And I was able to do my teaching began teaching courses for other teachers. And so. With my experience I am very good at reading stories to children. So I was given the opportunity to teach a class for other teachers. And. My reading technique. And so I did the course and there are few people in the courses and everything like that, and it went very, very well. And so. Maybe. It's been about 6 months since I've done that course. I was introduced. Two one of the participants of my course pride and other participants at it's in a different setting. And this particular participants told me how now whenever he read stories. He definitely thinks about my course. And he goes to the steps that I went through to make sure that he is. I'm getting the best experience to the children that he's teaching.	0
Hi so there's been several opportunities for me to lead others to a positive solution. I would say that. The reason that I feel like I'm capable of that is because I'm I try to be cool and. In stressful situations and I recognize that I'm not talking about the situation over and over again. It's going to lead us to a solution so. I'm thinking to a pretty dramatic situation, but I was a manager. I'm sorry marketing specialist for Red Bull. And we had a driver who was completely lost and we weren't able to acquire a signal in time. To make it to the next to our destination. So instead of us all being scared that we were lost. And we were never going to make it on time. You know, we were able to stop at someone's home. I was able to get out of the van. And ask to use someones Phone in residential area. We were able to make a connection with the venue and we get turn by turn. Directions and although we were late. They were they appreciated that we gave them the heads up and we were able to make the event. Everyone was less stressed because of the way that I kind of jumped in and made them feel confident that we would come up with a solution. It also recognizing that it wasn't going to be the end of the world if we didn't make it on time. And you know, there are a lot of opportunities to handle a situation in a dramatic fashion, which then leads to. People other people responding in a dramatic fashion and I think when you can really troubleshoot and you can work with the person or persons that are involved in the incident. Or the situation and really collectively. Get information and then come to the best conclusion together, everyone on board with that idea. It always leads to a positive outcome, so that's just sort of how I handle myself in stressful situations. Or where I need to probably positively influence others.	0

OK, a situation where I. Possibly influences actions and others would be, I guess in another. Jobs where There was There would be a lot of people that were coming at the same time, and because it was, it was so busy a lot of people would get. I guess because maybe they were impatient.

Sort of you know hearing what was going on. And basically the family was from a different country and they didn't speak any English. But at that point in time I had taken plenty of Spanish classes and spent a lot of time, practicing and. Now I speak a lot more, but even at the time I hit I went up in charge is my. Use my what I knew my knowledge of Spanish and I tried to explain to them that they were in the wrong line because the line that we were in was for single riders only. Any other other language for the whole family and they wanted to ride with the family. So I explain that to them just kind of watching the? The confusion go away from their face and everything that felt really good. I think that that's kind of A. A good point that I can think of difference to mine.	0

You know, making it more personalized if they were celebrating something special or I would do everything in my power to make it special for them because. I mean, who doesn't want that in customer service, you know at the end of the day I think treating people how you want to be treated.

This is the coolest. Opportunity I know it's frustrating, but we have to. Being still positive in a bright space for this company no matter what and I was also able to talk to management, and see if there was a way that they could. Uh not just to randomly put things out, maybe at one time a day or 2 times a day. Just send out a 2 different group texts with all the updates instead of randomly, sending the update. At all different times, so we would expect a morning and afternoon update versus just random chaos being thrown at us. And it really did help the way of the attitude of our team. It actually got me bumped up and promoted to a team leader and it was really exciting to just. See people go from like chaos to just. Attacking all the goals and having a good attitude while doing it.	0

So it's not really good to know that we help them deal with really. Difficult situation in a way that they got their family back connected in together for A. For a start time and help you refuse some confusion disorientation whenever she was going through that made it difficult for her so. It was really satisfying to get her all the way through her gate.

In some of my previous work experience I've worked on grants as well as a different projects, sometimes coming into those grants as a project coordinator or manager, you come into hostile situations in those situations. People can already have preconceived notions of what's expected or wants to come in a way that I've changed the part, the thoughts of others and created a positive situation. Working on a grand MLK day of service. Grant there was a lot of hostility with a new coordinator coming in I made sure that everyone felt comfortable with who I am as a person with my leadership style as well as what we were looking to do moving forward. It's very important to make sure that you allow People to understand you're not there to change everything completely. But you want to find out what works what works what doesn't work and what we can do to to move? Forward, together. I believe that leadership style will help you positively positively influence the thoughts of others. It's important for everyone to feel that there are part of the solution that the part of the team thinking and then that think tank because buying making everyone feel inclusive in creating those procedures, then we're all that much more of a team when it comes time to execute.	0

As a teacher, I was able to. Be put in situations on a regular basis, where I was expected to change kind of the outcome of the situation by changing. People behavior sometimes. Student behaviors and sometimes parents behaviors. They were both my jobs, so that was in my class recently had a lot of developmentally. Developmental delays and some situational anxiety, he was really nervous about coming to school and his mother was also really. Nervous about coming to school an and it was definitely wearing off on him throughout the first couple months at school. We had several meetings and I was able to talk to her. Our regular basis openly and I was able to talk to her to her sign my student as well on. Daily basis and I just really spent a lot of time, reassuring them that their safety and happiness or education. Were Top of my priority list and I was going to do everything in my possibilities to make their transition to? I'm in pool. Easy and positive and I really think that I had a great positive influence on the student and the parent because. After the first couple months of school. The student just started just trust me and relax. He knew that he was going to be safe and comfortable and well taken care of. And I know that his mother felt the same way and his behavior just completely changed, he opened up, he was. Able to learn he made new friends. It was such a great thing to watch it was a really beneficial relationship that I. I'm glad at the beginning, I spent time nurturing that relationship with my student in my parents because it.

Yes, Good afternoon is glad I'm glad to be here. I have many situations when I positively influence. The actions of others. One example comes to mind it right away. It was recently our work in a school system. A public school system work with a lot of children's in middle school and also adult I was able to encounter a situation. When a teacher was scolding a child and I was very slow to respond to that situation, although I thought it was. Overboard, the reason I responded positively was because I know the child. The child had been in my class and also little background on the child. The child that had some problems at home and I was aware of it. I was able to reach over to the Kingston just whisper in her ear to let her know what was going on and ask her if it was OK. If she would allow me to speak with the channels you allow me too. and I spoke for the child put her outside and she just basically started crying and broke down and made what was happening in our home that her father had gotten deported recently. And she was just upset and didn't know what to do and she was acting out. So I listen to her ask her if she thought that that was the best course of action. She said no. But I was angry and I asked her what should she do. She responded in a positive manner. The teacher that I also talked to and team up with was very thankful that we handled it in that way. And she understood a little bit more about the child's background. Those are just some of the situations that I come in contact with a regular basis, then these are things that I think we can do to help improve the lives of others and it helps to fill my day I really enjoy working with People. And I enjoy working and helping to see People to achieve you whatever it is they want to achieve on a daily basis.	0

Hello sorry about that for this question. I have to relate back to my job when I was selling by the sleep number part of that job was. Working on a team and we used to practice our sales what they called selling by numbers and a part of that was. Really being able to listen and have empathy for our customers as they came in and another part of that was being able to give. Constructive criticism to our other employees so that way we could work together and build each other up and make sure that when our customers came in We were prepared. And so in order to do that, we would come in act as if we were a customer and then give feedback. And a hard time with that, you know with certain employees was that they didn't know how to I guess communicate. Or take that feedback so something that I've had to learn how to do was. Incorporate humor, but also incorporate their positive so you know, making sure you give somebody. What they're doing right 1st and then of course where they can you know correct themselves obviously we're working on a team? It sounds like for new to sales so you know was our answer always correct. Maybe not, but it was good to go through this scenario, so that way. When we were practicing or did have the actual cell coming through we would know a different answer or a way to overcome. An objection you know, closing the sale is very hard specially when you're selling $10,000 beds and so. Team being able to construct the feedback and then of course, landing the smell out of that.	1
A time when I was. Empire time when I was able to positively positively. And Department action to others was when I worked for the hotel, which is Aria an we were in housekeeping. An we were in Krisha's in our supervisor was just going over the pre shift and just everybody just seemed like they were just down and out. And so you know, I ask the manager if I could just speak and just try to get the. Get them round about their job. Even though we know it's a hard job and it's and it's sometimes trying. It's just it wasn't good for me to give him a pep talk and just kinda to get them to see things. On my way. I just let him know that everybody needs and just have a good day keep it up keep everything positive. Um all the customer is always right. Um and I'm sorry for them, but in the customer is always right. Also, just to be a great influence and just keep dividing the energycap up and going amongst others you know just. I'm trying to get positive feedback and make my my coworkers. See things you know, my windows were in pre shipping. Everybody is looking so down and out and tired and so I just you know active I can just give it pep talk. And among you know your peers, so let him know you know, so they can see the Energycap Ann. Everything for now did everybody's Day was good. We finished and made our quota, so that was good for me.	0
I would say that I really miss situation where I was able to have a positive influence on other people. This when I was standing on any for a couple of different families and it was a very rewarding. On a hard job, but it was really nice to watch the children growling to know that I was. For them to look at you.	1
A few years ago, I used to work as a secretary for my church. And it was a role where a lot of people were coming by daily and I had the opportunity to. Before its many of the children in the ministry and just to be able to talk to them. Sometimes they would come up the office. And they would argue with. That's right, yeah, adult children much doing it didn't wanna do something or about school work and stuff and. Able to sit down with me. Just talk about like how grown-ups think and just to be able to calm them down explain? Then why they were told to do what they were doing what they were supposed to use and to me. Later on being able to see them becoming like young adults and just to be able to deal with other people better and to understand. But they were supposed to do rather than just listen and do it for me, it was a great experience in. I received many compliments for mothers that thanked me for helping their children to understand some of the things and. For me was very sorry to be able to touch their lives in that way.	1
So one situation that I can think of where I could positively influence someone else was actually during college. We got put into groups and had to do a public presentation in front of the class one girl in my group name is Margaret. And she was petrified of speaking publicly so I would meet with her after class we would go to each other's houses. We did for about a week. And we practiced talking where she was the person talking and then I was the audience and then vice versa. So that I could help get her prepared on in order to speak and some more comfortable in front of a group. Do we even practice we would have some of our other friends come and sit before the big day so. Definitely that would be a time where I think I was positively influencing her and come to find out we did this. Enter the class it was our anatomy and Physiology class to be exact and we've gotten 8 so she did great. I did great everyone loved it. In his turns out, she wasn't quite as bad as she thought she would be so that ended up being great.	1
I was able to help others become more positive in a work environment and without work environments. There's been many times in the customer service industry where I have had to take a deep breath. Within myself and say you know what team we're going to take some deep breaths. We're going to. Be more positive we're going to work harder and through that you know, we've accomplished much more and worked harder together. And I think that I am pretty good at getting everyone to calm down and let's stay positive and let's.

And I think that the outcome is always amazing and I hope to show you more that I can do that as well.	1

So it's fine where I would say that we have positively influence the actions of others. Uh would have to be this past year as an American member and it was working at school. So I had a lot of opportunities to positively impact students on a daily basis. Um. I remember that feeling situation would be when one of the students who are near and dear to my heart. We had a really good relationship throughout the year and she came to me really upset and angry about. The situation that happened in another classroom not in my classroom and so during the time she's pretty upset, she's. Angry shoes customer, she's like I'm going to cuss this lady out and I was like. Bullet with XR so you know, I'm asking her questions. You know, getting hard to think about. How her actions that she's talking about at this moment are going to negatively impact her future you know she's a really good student throughout. Um. Like academically, she's really good, but sometimes you know, she just stays away in just goes off, sometimes when people. And so in that moment you know, I just was talking to her and just really. Getting her to understand how her actions are going to affect her. And so instead of her going back into the classroom and you know, cutting the future out she instead. We took a break together, we walked around and then she went back into the class and continue class. As usual, so I'm not good in the future out, no trouble or anything like that just by having that conversation with her and getting her to really just. Think about her actions.	0

OK, so the question is describe a situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others. I used to be. A flight attendant. Prior to my application. And. There was a situation on board the aircraft. We're I. Um. Let's see I'm thinking of two situations. Let me just bring up one of them. Uh OK. Where I had? A partner. Who this is more like almost conflict but then positive in the end? A partner who she Unfortunately. Was taking things from the? Forward Gary. Alcohol. Retro sexy and I approached her after the fact only because she made me aware of it, she said. Well, you know. Uh we have a layover. She basically stated that she was going to go and relax and she had some of the. Or alcohol in a gallon and I sort of said. Hey, you know what? Oh. Are we supposed to? Do then there's other ways that we can go about? Doing things. Without doing it in this manner. And. You know, I told her I said, You know this is against the policy. Quite frankly I don't think it's the best thing. But I approached her in. A very subtle way. And. You know, I said no. If anything, you could always. Somewhere locally as long as you know within a 12 hour. Frames and she. Went and put it back and we were good.	0
So to describe the situation that made me impact other positively was at my last job where I was a server. Glass host. For Ballpark Village in Saint Louis Blues are in it was doing during the blue season game we want I don't know. You are now by saying well, I'm from St Louis, Mo Saint Louis deal when Saint Louis Blues did. Win the Stanley Cup this year and I was working at a bar called Ballpark village so within that. Sorry I was not delete server, but I did sometimes paper lead in situations that needed to be taken. Leader. So one time with the secular it was during one of the final game for the Blues and and my job we will be jam packed. So the servers we were all just including me out with a little flustered as well because it was really busy it was really packed it was a lot going on. Within our facility at the time. So the service. I had gathered gathered all of these servers within the back kitchen so that we can have a little quick huddle, and get back to work since we all seem to be running around with their heads cut off. I will basically get it gathered everyone gathers everyone together. An maybe speech like I was the head coach of a football team is just made them. Feel like they're greater job because they are, and we can do this we can give great service and make sure that. Everything flows smoothly during this busy season there were having so that's a good example that I feel would. But the question that was asked.	0
I currently work at Starbucks and a positive action. I took influence. Others is I found one of my brief is getting very flustered on bar. So I told her to just call me take a deep breath. It is just coffee.	0
We recently had a few of our oldest members leave the company unexpectedly. And morale is kind of down on our Department and I took it upon myself to try and get us all together to bring around back up. I helped put together a a potluck style dinner on which we brought things also caters come in. And it really brought him around back up. It helps us reconnect with each other that even though these. These great people are gone. We were able to bring it all together and was able to positively influence them and realize OK. We can do this with or without. These people who had gotten him for so long. So I'd say that's fine. It's probably my most recent tile is able to influence others in a very positive way.	1
When I was by myself when I was 1 customers and they were going to charge here I come over. And. It was a little bit difficult, but I was able to activate any that problem and. And I explained really good to my customer with the problem and there, I was not happy with the situation. Ann. So I'll explain to her really good. And the conditions of. Coming over to my business and it will be happy, ending and that would be awesome that I've heard.	0
So the time that I had to possibly positively influence. Others was a time when I worked at a direct service provider. Positioning and I had to come one of my clients and so you know, making the right decision. It was something really small. Which was Making the right decision on something to drink which was soda. And I might have to just positively influence him to make the right decision. It's a drinking something he should be drinking, which was water.	0
OK so um my last 2 years I was a student athlete at a University in New Jersey. My team and I were having a lot of trouble with our coach in the athletic Department. So a lot of us were having trouble in which we didn't know which direction to turn would speak to and a lot of us felt as if our voices weren't being heard. But I took the responsibility of giving hope to the team and giving confidence to my fellow teammates to say that like. You know it's OK to speak. It's OK to have an opinion on something just because it goes against. With somebody else is saying doesn't mean that it's wrong and in the beginning, they were very hesitant about like. Just speaking out and being responsive about giving their feelings on. Being responsive and being receptive to their feelings instead of to themselves. So I gave them a lot of confidence. I gave them a lot of power within themselves then. In the beginning, they were afraid to speak up to the coach and you know just have a conversation in order to better ourselves as a team. And then in the end, we ended up having a meeting with her we ended up sitting down with her we made changes within the team. We use our voices. We used our power as individuals and as a group and that is how I positively influence. Others around me and that was the most recent situation of that happened as well.	0
So a situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others would be, I was a trainer. My last job where it was very customer service space. So I would say waitress there? How's the moon and I got to teach my fellow employees? How to Take care of people and how to negate more negative situations when they do arise, which happens in the customer service industry. So I was able to teach them to you know if you don't know the answer to something you can go and. Is there anything? I don't know she would guess you can go and find out the answer for them?

OK, so I would like to describe a time where I got to work with a coworker who was. A little older than me, she had been working at my current job. Before I worked there her name was Karen and she was approaching her 70s and then. I really got to know her and we became friends and it was just great to learn from her. But she was a little bit more set in her ways. And there were new processes of doing things in accomplishing. Things for example, making products that she didn't feel comfortable with. She was not accustomed to those and so. I was there, um truly just try and help encourage her to take on these new tasks and. I did get to know her well and we talked about our days and we talked about you know. Alright then we got to know each other right. But at the same time I wanted to maintain a level of professionalism and efficiency so I just encouraged her to. You know training task for example, instead of hand tapping things, which took longer I encouraged her to simple things that. We sell so she didn't want to crank the machine as fast as it goes because she didn't want it. You wear out the machine but the reality is if that's what's happened happening, then that's just the natural course of the machine will just get a new one and stuff. Wasn't about what she couldn't do. But what she could do so. I just encourage her to try every single day. Looking better and be better and we just want to lighten up the mood in the workroom.	1

My coworker came up to me and told me how it was very hard for her to really help keep up. With everything in the store and she was kind of getting a bit frustrated, but he said that she saw how positive I would think towards everyone. And trying to get to everyone you know in a timely manner, and making sure that I wasn't you know. Forgetting peoples need and so she said that that helps her out a whole lot. And it made her want to do better with her work. And so I told her that there have been plenty of moments where you know it wasn't always sure. Ingram is really keep a brave face and make sure that I just did. My job ended it to the best of my abilities. And she said that that really inspired her and help her to do better too.	1

We had 3 people attack with the parties so that everybody could get garden timely matter, we can get their food. In their drinks delivered in a timely matter, and then everybody could go home in a timely matter, so we worked as a team. To get the task done an instead of? You know.

I have a situation that I am going to describe happens at work quite often. I work at a hotel at the front desk. Easy as well as a supervisor majority of the time when gas or not having a good stare anything am I see my coworkers getting flustered. I usually try to look at the situation after guess what we can do for them and then come up with a solution with my. Pull workers on the best ways to accommodate our guests situation being when the weather is not permitted here in Las Vegas and the pool has to be closed. Guess of course come to Las Vegas or come to our hotel specifically for the pool that is why they pay the resort fee. And once we close the pool because we have no control the weather alot of guests become upset. Understandable is out of our hands you know, we can't control the weather. But we also want to make sure that our guests have a great time. Even though the main reason the game was for the pool so a solution that I usually come with. Come up with and try to help my coworkers. I'm getting bored with as well as management is maybe offering them $25 off of their food. Giving them like a vulture for drinks at the bar and then maybe giving them a pool pass for a later date. Now, if they're if they're able. Gas coming from out of state we tried to see if they will be able to come in on another date. I will accommodate perceived by giving them a free night. Those are just some things that we can do for I guess because they pay so much while they come through our hotel. Thank you.	1

A situation in which I had to positively influence. Others is during the breakfast time at my current job. Cleaning off the tables and taking out the trash for those customers that are dining with us. It's not part of my job description. But it's something that shows that I like to do is show them that we care and that we are here to provide the level of service in the hospitality field. So with that some of the guests do to us and that's how I made my way up in the ranks. And that's what made me to be the front desk manager at this point in time. So when my front desktop sees me going. Out of my way to help another guest. It motivates them to do the same and then they can get such a positive feedback as well.	0
I've been in the hospitality industry for. About 1516 years now. Restaurants restaurant management. And probably Possibly. Getting others. Actions. Is? With in regards to slow times at work. Even though it is slow and the employees are really not making money Unfortunately. There's always something to do. So pretty much in a day-to-day life, I drank slow times, I have them clean. Maintain the area in the atmosphere that we have keep everything sanitary. And. I guess that we do have. I've tried to make them give a connection with these guys. Because.

Hi I was able to successfully influenced others when we had when I was working. As a Event planner, we had to organize a big event for some of our Top clients and. Some of our. People wanted to do it one way uhm. Which was not going to be cost effective or efficient and I was able to run a report have the numbers and showed them exactly why we needed to do it another way.

So a situation in which I was. Able to positively influence actions of others. I work in a child care, setting right now. A lot of the time we have children who present challenging behaviors. That's kind of the philosophy of life, you do listen inclusion philosophy. So. There was a situation in which the child was running around the classroom and throwing things and hitting people and. A lot of the teachers. Said that he only responded when you were strict with him and. I just didn't find that this worked for him. At least not in the way that we wanted it to. So I started to. Whenever he would do this set him down. Talk to him ask him why he's feeling this way why he's doing these things. Ann. It might take him a little longer to calm down when we did that, but it would have more of A. Response from her. And so. Once I started doing this other teachers going to see that this really works for him. And. So then they started to do that with him and I think that that is. Much more impactful on his future and his life to be able to talk him through his feelings. And. Continue this process as he grows up instead of just yelling at him because that's not. A positive effect on him and I think. Having him talk about his feelings about us understanding his feelings had more of a positive effect on him.	0
OK so at times, I was able to positively influence. No, the actions of others was actually when I was a manager at a movie theater. And. It wasn't a coworker it was apparent there was a customer.

Customers in the movie theater trying to watch movie and that they're complaining, saying that you're being loud and. I'm gonna have to take you out, and he started to get rowdy. An I told him that listen. I don't wanna like quality parties, but I will if I have to. And I kinda just tried to explain him thing like to calm down. It's not that serious she's gonna make it. Serious and worse for him not even for me, I'm just letting him know how good and handed out. Calming down and at the end of the movie theater. Customers came in thanked me and told me that he stopped being rowdy at the movie theater and. That you're talking to me. And he apologized and said that he knew he was in the wrong he was overreacting any apologize for being. Uh. Publicly intoxicated none.	0
Suddenly, at my job and my health unit coordinator which means I'm basically the secretary to a whole entire hospital. And I was on the Hospice for this past week and I thought family of course, that was indeed. Pain is a family member one time so I took it upon myself. It was situational awareness where I went. And I looked it in the patients file to see what religion really work. So I could bring a priestess it with the family. And then I also got together, the team on that unit in the Hospice unit and we got the family card to say we're just thinking about. And if they need anything in that I'm a great just let us know will be there to support them 110%. And then we also got them in Angel pin because we knew a lot about their family member who is dying and they really, really believed in Angels? And we have their name engraved on it, so that my peers and everything for the family and even to us. So that's a cheap situation boys. Yes, they did have a loved one dying but positively we include them by having hope. Everybody was passionate passionate passionate and taking care of their loved one in that were there to support them 110%. And the door is always open for them to, if they needed anything and that was the positive influence that we had on others.	1

In Germany was able to positively influence the reaction of others was definitely whenever I was working in a team. Environment where we all had to give our inputs in also receive other insights. Without within in a positive way I was able to get my insert on the idea that the team should used. All working together and buy also respecting the opinions of others during situations. This was whenever I was working. In my public relations internships and we had to deal with a lot of crisis management. Fashion that's definitely situation where I felt that I was able to positively influence others, especially maintain a positive attitude during a stressful situation.

In a situation where I was able to influence the attitude and actions of others would be an instance where we were delayed. That I was working for 3 hours when we finally were able to board the plane passengers came on being very aggressive. Very angry and upset with the delay in everything, which is completely valid and understandable. I did my best to keep calm be positive. Inform the passengers that. Just like this now safe and that we were ready to go and we were going to make up as much time as possible. In doing something so positive and trying to make them feel a little bit better about their delay answering any questions that they had in keeping a positive attitude. With a genuine insincere smile. I was able to take their hostility and their anger an all of their frustration and they? In turn return my kindness by apologizing being polite, said not just myself in the other planets in it, but the other passengers. Offering to help offering other situations where they could rent a car and drive to another airport. Or drive the rest of the way they are together. And in the end, they ended up thinking it because my positive attitude as they said really changed their day made it better. Make them feel like everything is going to be fine and I took great heart and knowing the fact that I was able to just. Change someone's Day just by being nice and a little bit positive and just making that much more of a difference to someone.	1
Well, I was the captain cheerleader at Savannah State University. So I had to deal with bad attitudes all the time and. Everyone not wanting to practice so just to have everyone in low spirits and be able to have Adobe personality like me and it had everyone laughing. I think you're dumb positively, which made us win 1st place at a competition. So I wouldn't bring that traffic spirit because no one ever wants to have that. Negative spirit finances more negative spirit, so I just try to be that. Opposite person.	1
One situation that I remember where I was able to positively influence the actions of others in a previous. Airline position I was on the ground on the ramp and what I would normally do on every flight. That we upload and download is that during the boarding process. I would go up and get gay chat. Um. With the gate checks. I would go if I had the time, too, if there wasn't any ready yet. I would sit up there and wait once we've already done the upload. I would sit there and wait to see if we had any gauge shotgun, a full flight. So, in particular, Orlando flights of course, there's a lot of kids so once once once I had a flight that I actually. I had a bunch of flight, with loaded with with folks in bags are full I would go up. And actually sit there and wait for the gate checks and as they would go as the kids will go buy it. I should give them high fives and give him more little pounds. Uh as I would say just again just just just to give him that and have that with them. For a while, I was doing that for awhile just off the strings were just doing it. Once I was up there. I started to notice that other folks were doing the same as well, where I would actually take I was actually taking place. Shortly after that, and some of the crew that I would work with I see them. I say Hey. They're actually giving pounds in high fives to kids well again just to have that just to have that. The connection that the kids can have the connections to slide to have a safe flight. Some of these things may be scared. Or just wanna get home or they may be flying alone, but again, it's just to have that connection just to just to kind of give that service all the way around, but that was something that. So I found that was catching on and it became a thing where we were we would give kids in a little town. They have them to let them know that you have a safe flight.	1

A timer I was able to positively positively influence the actions of others would have to be multiple times in the military. But one time in particular was when I had a soldier on my team who is struggling with uh. PT so. I took it upon myself to practice with them since. I'm only in the National Guard. We have our drill weekend. Once a month and then we have our annual training for about 1 to 3 weeks every year so. Since this older was struggling with PTSD. I took it upon myself to take the time out of my week at least once a week too. Run them because the roundness thought they were failing. So for about a couple months. From one PDF for the next Iran weekly with this folder and then they were able to pass so I positively influenced. Their actions by Motivating them, helping them and just being that person to push them along.	1
And the situation that I can think of that is recent where I was able to influence others in a positive manner. Was? At my job my current job as a bartender at the recently got. New management. And he decided to change up the way that. Our schedules were made and. A lot of the girls that I work with were very upset. And. Wanted to. Take action in the way of. Calling HR about. Certain things in order to get this person fired. And so I just took it upon myself since I'm a trainer, too. Talk to my peers and tell them that. This is just a temporary situation and he is. Trying to figure out his way through how he? I scheduled should work because he doesn't know us. And so I tried to make them feel like. OK let's give him a chance before we make any like rash decisions that he might not deserve. Ann. And we will later regret so I think being able to talk people down from pulling the trigger on a situation where? You know it could end. Just negatively I was able to do that, and I feel pretty good about that.	0

A couple years ago when I was working at the sandwich place called Jersey Mikes. There was a lot of new people were helping open a new restaurant. In our as a shift leader there and there are a lot of high school kids that were just. Starting to work never had jobs before an I think that one thing that was super cool is that I was able to teach them a lot of like. And team building skills a lot of them had never worked in a restaurant before so I was able to kind of. Leave them and show them like. How to interact with customers? How to show excellent customer service and how to go out of your way to people and I think that. The store open it was a huge success and it really was offered because I feel like a lottery ticket. A lot of the high schoolers, even though I was only a couple years older than them. I was really able to. Having a positive impact on their first drive, an intern that made all the customers happy we were able to have. OK team right for her and just kind of able to really have a positive environment at the store. And I was really able to have a lot of them be really positive team players while I was there.	1
So you can solution but I was able to positively influence the actions of others. Was when I worked previously for the Walt Disney travel companies? Are was part of their call center King? So I spoke directly through to travel agents to be able. To work with someone smoking their vacation plans for their deaths per people out there trying to put on vacation. And usually when it came to very limited availability with saying it was either the rooms or the number of. Guess that can't that. Governor comedy at the time is something wasn't available. I can I would definitely give them other options and usually? With.

Describe a situation in which you're able to positively influence the actions of others. I would think. I'm doing my work as a patient care technician. There's a lot of. Uh. Like safety. Steps that you need to go through 2. Before starting a treatment for a patient so it's like kind of a whole checklist. Each kind of clinic has like their own culture and environment. So I notice when I went from I transferred from one location to another. I started working with a new group of people and I notice that some of them weren't doing. On the safety checks in the way that we have been trained they were doing it kind of their own way. And I just notice by. Like instead of. Joining them and doing it their way, I just kept doing it, the way that I had been trained. And for my previous clinic. And I know this after a couple weeks that instead of like there being any conference about it. I just kind of lead by example. That everyone else. Just eventually started doing it that way again too. I think they're just kind of maybe for God or gotten like the habit of not doing it. So I just I think that. It was a positive thing because there was no conflict about it. And it wasn't like you're doing this wrong or your this is the way you should be doing or I just showed them like. The way that you're supposed to do it by doing it. Instead of telling them and then just show them like how possible it is, and it's not that much harder and it doesn't take that much more time just to do it, the way that we're supposed to do it.

We all end up working together really great.	1

Hello I would have to say at times that I had to positively influence the actions of others would possibly be. Carl's been a drivers of past couple years I had to train from various employees. And a lot of them got frustrated with different things that had to take place. So I basically told them the positive ways to do things. As far as I don't look at it as just driving every day look at it as getting customer what they need. So I mainly told them just everyday coming with a different attitude coming with today from these different customers are going to be different. And just don't ever think of it as being over just driving job is not just a driving job. You're basically getting customers what they need 'cause. We deliver automotive parts. We were getting customers. What we need so they can satisfy their customers in terms. So it's basically it's a whole ladder of assehole ladder effect, so don't think of it just Oh. I'm just delivering for this company no. You're actually getting customers what they need so they can provide the same service to their customers customer service is needed. Everywhere so whether you're just driving your car or whether you are working in a counter at a fast food restaurant. Office answering telephones, it's all about customers and you have the positive lead sit there and you know, do things in a proper manner, so that way things can get. Done effectively and if you don't take it seriously, then you jobs, not gonna get done properly so I always tell my trainees. Think positively it looks fabulous because Oh you're driving in your free yeah. That's good after a while, it will take it already. But look at it this way, you're getting a job done to get customers what they need to make them. Satisfied, which will interns satisfy you.	1
A time where I was actually able to influence others. I worked an English Department chair as English Department chair I was able to work. With all English teachers, not only at my location, but also at 4 other schools. When I was able to do, we had to, I was responsible to? Manage a lot of the events for our teachers as well as our students. So one thing I was able to do is during the meetings I would also. Listen to everyone's input and then from there, I would do an amalgamation of what everybody says, and then create an event from there. The result of the action was really great because I had a lot more inquiry. and I had a lot more investment into the program because I actually listen to what everyone had to say. Which was really helpful for me because when you're in English Department he ran with your English teacher you want to make sure that you're speaking and listening to. I mean, the visuals that actually are incorporated or involved in the Department and then also you're able to take it inquiry of. And the students and what their interests are as well. So unable to influence everyone by being able to create a program that everybody was interested in. It was not that great because the tours of the students went out the investment of the teachers went up. And overall I enjoyed it very much.	1

Sling sing. Others is basically to allowing them to understand where you're coming from and then also giving them. NS college reasons as to why so a good example is in the corporate world. There are many times that. I need to get others input and the way that I basically do that is by. Discussing the part the positives as to why they should get on board and also answer a lot of their questions, which a lot of times. It really boils down to an interpretation. Um they believe that that their idea is better than yours. Or they believe that their their thinking is a little bit better, so. Um really it's all about understanding where you're trying to go and then um convincing them in a very positive way. Why they should come on board and believe in your way or your situation so again a lot of times in the corporate world. That has to be done. I'm almost on a daily basis. Whether you're asking for their help with your asking for their input. With your asking for their body, and I think a lot of times on this situation is how it really goes.	1

That would have definitely been something that would influence the actions of others always was just by. Providing them with the tools and information they needed to. Get the results that they wanted and it almost positive way I would never wish. Hell on anyone that would come in or do anything to jeopardize their faith or whenever they're concerned with.	1

The first thing you see when you walk in the door, I set the tone for everything I interact with. All of the fast. However, I'd like to tell you the story from a time when I was a flight attendant. During which we got sucked on. The tarmac for like 2 hours and this was after we are you boarded and come on another plane because of technical difficulties. Truck is running high with. Crew as well as passengers. And everyone got on that plan really terrible mood, however. Um. Hi. Instituted a powwow in the back with my other crew member she never both brand new. And we need a game plan. And we Went ahead and as soon as we had the plane off the ground. We did or beverage service. We handed out drinks left and right reported cocktails.

Recently I was on a flight, leaving from Reagan National Airport, an I notice. The young lady in distress with a tiny infant on her hip. And the husband was trying to gather as much luggage as he could. And I've never had children myself, but I could just see that look of distress on her face. So I went over as they were trying to board an I offered to help them with any bags. I curd or any of the babies items. I found it where they were seated and she was really a little overwhelmed. I got them to their seats and I gave up my feet so they could sit together and lo and behold. Everybody else around us was opening bins for them and helping them get seated an asking if they need anything. And it just think that once you start to chip in an you help out. Others people see that. Any more participate as well. And I'm hoping I can show those examples with Frontier Airlines.	1

A time when. The time when I had to positively influenced actions of others. When I was working at the Sonic restaurant. I was actually managing and our company was going through a lot of policy changes as we were going through new ownership changes. And the staff there words very much fans of going through those kind of changes there was a lot of. Safety regulation changes and different things like that, and there's a lot of things that they've already been used to doing so. While they were complaining about that I took the opportunity to encourage them, but the fact that you know. Even though they may be different. There's a lot more safety involved in all of those things and can keep are in a better place. So I just came out. It was a good attitude and just told him. Hey guys, you know if we just give this a shot. It might even be easier for us overall and allow us to operate a lot better than we have been so let's go ahead and give it a shot. The outcome from that was actually wonderful everybody had a really great attitude did what they needed to do and. Like I had mentioned so damn. It did end up being a little bit easier.

One of my favorite situations. So I like to talk about is when I worked in retail. I was a manager. Walmart actually and we had a gentleman who was frequently returning merchandise that actually was never even purchased our story didn't even sell this stuff. And our associates were just curious the they were up in arms status because this guy was kept coming in. All that I'm returning this merchandiser trying to and we don't even sell this stuff. And so they called me up one day may want me to deny his merchandise and basically just tell the guy off. Ann. I mean, they they were choosing the Sky terribly because they were offended there protecting the story protecting our bottom line. And they wanted me to enforce the rules so I'm hired to do the first policy right. And I'm also trying to understand that customers are people. And also materials person so I went up to this gentleman and I want to figure out what's going on. Why is this happening so I found out very quickly and talking to him? His wife had cancer and it was taking all the money that he had. So what I did I told him that we can't take this much nice but I want you to come back. One week from today. And what we did is we raised we raised money for it. And Richland first wife and so the very same people who had been antagonizing him. Actually gave him a check for his wife, who was dying of cancer and it's a bad situation turned into a positive one.	1
I feel like I can name a number of situations where I've had the opportunity to positively influence home. Other people, whether it be in school and school setting works church anywhere. I do too. I think my personality issues. I'm expression approachable person, I physically have such a pleasant date, so season 2. Charlie tells me so I think you know for example, if I smile at someone, and they just smiled back. Maybe they weren't having a great day. So it looks like in a word situation, I would say. Um. I would say I'm actually. A team leader at my job like I work directly under my manager so. There is literally a number of situations that are getting them again. So I don't know where is it? But it's really just in everyday life, I can. I think I am a positive improvement to other people? I like conversation, I don't think there's any automatic saving. Hope you like it, too short so.	1
Hi there, my name is Michaela Proctor, an describing a situation where I was able to positively influence someone has happened a couple times throughout my life. In high school I was involved in a lot of different activities. You know band Gymnastic. Palm things like that, so I felt like. I'm in a group setting it's just kind of like everyone coming together through on their ideas out there together anything like Oh, Hey, yeah, that sounds good. Or. That works with all maybe you know put our heads together and think of something else. and I think that in the past. I've had some great ideas that my peers have supported. And that we've used and they've worked out an now that I'm in my adult life I do real estate. An hour ago, I know some people may know or they may not in real estate when your client may feel. You know unsure about some things or if you have a new buyer who is not really sure how the process works. You have to give them that comfortable feeling you have to give them that reassuring feeling that. It's all gonna be OK and we have your best interest at heart. So I think that come as far as positive influence goes. I just give my opinion, I shoot my ideas out there. And I just kinda see where people go with it and what their feedback, maybe and we go from there.	1
Open Google. I was having a discussion with my coworkers. Oh no. Free time that we had until we had The Avengers. Justice. And. These are 2. Have a higher tone of voice and I was able. 2. Intervene and have them start again. But we have a definite are waiting for us to give them event after service.	0
Hum. Civility intervention in the actual devices recently couple weeks ever in my actual job. As you know the computers at will shut down. System was shut down. Then everybody there's knew everybody there is like a young people and making working in customer service's restaurant business. A long time. Everybody was like a little freak out, we're going to do with our system where we going to do now, with the customers. So I'll just tell them OK listen. I know what I can. Like old fashion at Chase. And take the information and the menu and everybody will be alright so if you want I can help you and. This tells you customers we have a situation on the computer side. We were trying to make it easy and. We would be OK. So they've been looking like OK. Thank you for your help. I think we will be alright and thinking that it was almost. Time for a close restaurant by. Yeah, I think that helps a lot I was under control. I wasn't on their planet. Because supplements could be a mad or you know they want to go home. Or they're ready for the checking. They think we're taking too much time, but it wasn't bad. I think it was very good influence. Show to them, I am under control and I know what to do. That moment so. Yeah, I think that was a good thing.	0
One situation that I can remember is working in a call center. Ann I make sure to go the extra mile. To make sure that they get the help that they need it's about understanding the customer so I have. And Apple of times. Hearing my Conor to that customer to make sure that they get everything that they need. So it's about giving my loving kindness to the customer and making sure that they are being understood.	0
So one example in which I was able to positively influence others with we had one day at work where? 5 people were scheduled in only 2 showed up. Not including myself, so that was 3 total and what happened is they ended up getting all upset because obviously those extra work that didn't come in. We absolutely need it and so I just kind of started you know, making you know. Lightning the atmosphere with jokes. I started talking about you know, OK well if you were in this situation you know how would you do? Sheriff against this so I'm kind of. Distracted them from the fact that we were under prepared to handle the day, it kind of started out with. You know they were saying stuff along the lines of you know, we're never going to get this done. And so I would set up stuff like Healthcare. Here's here's here's how we're going to do it. Let's start. Are sperm cells are a challenge? Let's see? How much we can get done in 10 minutes and you know as long as we're doing, it correctly and not doing it rushed. It was it was a men's finance so we were able to actually get more done than initially anticipated even from our managers. They complemented us on the fact that we were able to get a lot more done than expected simply because having a good attitude. I believe personally, I believe that it is it makes the experience so much more better on an individual. And then having a grumpy attitude or having that negative aspect so I'm. I was able to help get the job done in the way that it was so desired. Simply by being friendly, you know being positive being happy about it, making a game out of it as you know with safety in mind of course. And yeah that's one example in which I was able to take a negative situation and turning positive.	1
Oh. I'm gonna say. You know like I'm walking together an? You know you know you know working as a team. And then I don't know what to say about the influence. I mean, but I really don't understand the question. But. To my knowledge. Is? Working together an? I mean nice. Working together as a team man. I mean? You know like You actually question then. I'm trying like giving you giving them an ad vice. I mean, you know, I'm telling them what to do or. Just opinion my Honda Pina you know that I'm not going to tell him exactly what you do just an opinion. On my own opinion. Anything is not going to be by repeating it gonna be a good one that I know that I can do. Myself. For myself so. I think that is, I mean? what I understand about. I mean, the question. I don't really like I said, I don't really understand. This person really meaning I wish I can get more estimate nation about that question so. Thank you.	0
Saying that only younger. Female and I. Work with more older adults in the I'm young. I try my best to encourage them to do is mostly Camera or something that they may lack I'm able to show them so. They look up to me as a role model and because I'm young and I'm experience and stuff like that, so they tend to shadow me a little bit because you know, I'm young. I'm quite experienced so I impact them so much because I'm able to teach. Then think that I know or that I'm expert at.	0
An application where I think I was possibly able to influence the actions of others was while I was in college. I played pennies for for the tennis team in my school. That's the reason I came 1st in the United States. And uhm actually looks at him work all the time and I constantly influence. All my all my teammates to to win a match when we were having a really time much. We all have to to help each other to support each other to to really be able to to to make. To win or even if we lose but you have a positive impact on our group, not to not to stress not to feel. Sign so I think by by being able to be in the Tennessee man having this opportunity, I was really. Able to to influence people and possibly by also being I consider myself a very calm person an unfriendly. And that always helps me to make relationships with people and people trust me an they like me an we. And we always connect with each other and creator upwards, an always have like great outcomes.	1
I work at the server right now and if you go in with a positive attitude. The other day one of my coworkers was having a really tough day. And when I came in with a positive attitude. It's just changed her attitude right up so if you're positive. Can you radiate positivity around you than most the time it will help less other people out so I think that's the best way to go for it.	1
So official nations that I was able to positively influence action of others. Would be a situation with me working for the United Postal Service every year around. May we have what we call a food drive. Ann I am in charge of getting the whole thing together. I kind of coordinate the event, so we have one. Around that time I influenced my coworkers to get our customers going and excited to kind of system bags out to offer food for those in need. Once a year just just to give back in. It's a good car so I kind of encourage us in our field, not only just like us. Our bills, too, he just bring in and donate food to those in need because we do provide a service for everyone. And if we can give back to those in need. I encouraged us to do that every year around that time. Awesome around October for the breast cancer month I also encouraged Michael works to kind of donate to that. There's 2 like T shirt and do the walk, even though we don't have people in our family that are suffering from breast cancer encourage all of us to either donate or actually. Coming to the walk every year.	0

And although we already had a team huddle that day, I called them together and I just told him. A joke. To get everyone, laughing in to get everyone on the same page and just let them know look. We're in this together. We will get through today and so the result of that was that you know, people were talking about it. Code is is talking about it all day, saying Well, you know market like Jane called us together, He. Ted's laughing at you know, and so that was the main talk of the day so that's how I positively.

And I am looking forward to a new transition in transportation and hopefully with Frontier Airlines. As a flight attendant to answer the question how I positively influence. For instance, passengers on the cruise ship is being a demonstrator of how to Don your life jacket at my muster station. I was because I mean, I wasn't entertainer.

Um character traits and know how you can speak to one girl. How you can't speak to the other. Um. And it's really. You know how I think teacher you know students responds to teachers who are passionate about what they do, and that kind of goes with coaching as well so. I found that when I showed up. Positive and ready to go and I couldn't manage you and I put in the effort and I was prepared. They responded you know, an so when I coached it was a daily.

In my previous position as a senior exhibitor service coordinator I worked in resolutions Department and revolutions Department our task is to. Handle urgent an escalated situation so often frustrated customers. I took the approach to always look at my position. I've been on the side of the customer all the time because in that position, it's easy to slip into. Siding with our company when we're dealing with an escalation. Rather, there's a refund needed and service. A new service needed what have you. It's easy to take the approach of the company and slip into very company mode.

And that's one of the company rules and laws and it was stated in the books from your first. But you cannot let anyone in without proper identification. And. So I notice that he was. Constantly. Not. Finding the proper identification for the people, making sure that not making sure not holding the company rules that. He's supposed to do and making sure they're above 13 years old, and So what I did was. I kind of meant for him and I was like OK. Let's let's be sure that you keep up with the company policy. The rules integrity or morals, which is one of them. In my job so far is to keep it up and I think that by presenting myself in a professional manner. And constantly mentoring him like. You need to uphold the complete moved and you shouldn't go by the book because that's what you're supposed to do. That really influenced him too. He finally started coming together like. Hey, I do need to check the ideas. I need to make sure these different 13. I need to make sure there. They are on their I DS their passports. And so I I use this as 1 because I think I really positively affected affected how he presents himself in the workplace.	0

Hi the time that I was able to influence a positive impact for another was when I was working at Kay Jewelers. There was a Possible fiance for another that you know was in and out, thinking of what size diamond you know what? He was able to get for the first time for his future fiance. I was actually able to compare both diamonds. And actually explain the positive in the email compare the cons through the diamonds and he mentioned something a little bit more about his possible fiance.

Another person would do another thing another person or do another thing, so that we can compile altogether. At once so not just one person was being overwhelmed an you know not. Being stressful or anything like that, she had back up and she had at least 4 or 5 people with her. In order to get the bill complete so I believe that that's something that I influence to help make the situation a whole lot. For us and for my supervisor as well.	1

The form that they can only court for In addition to giving like a halftime pump up siege and in the huddles and Whatnot. I think that my own personal actions in the game was able to influence them because they saw that I was working as hard as I could they saw that I was giving it already had. And then there was a turning point in the game where I physically sacrificed my body and put my body on the line before. I think of the game, but more importantly for the sake of my team members because I knew how important it was to myself. As well as then because we've been working all season for this and then. After that, it really just spark to light in the rest of us. Everybody was just so in fire. Everybody was just so riled up after that, we all came together as a team. We do, we have to do we win that game?	1

Training a girl that was not really familiar with customer service. Her expectations were to learn within 2 weeks, which did not happen, she was really not. She had a problem with speaking with people and without people thinking that she was rude. I did give her a few tips on how to? Tone her boys and how she would be able to help somebody else by just answering the questions and not giving. Doing space expressions that people don't know. Final arguing and just saying yes because they were always pleasing. Our customer was always comes 1st and that really helped her out.

Hi Um, I currently work at an assisted living facility, so periodically I am. Challenge with a couple of elderly people who are angry about something up and mostly it's because they're frustrated. So I just I'm trying to think of a specific situation would be. I'm not getting the food they wanted so I usually will just. Tell them I'm really sorry that I can understand this is not exactly what you wanted to have today, but what I can do. Is go back try to get you exactly what you want? And uh see if you like that anything I could do to change their attitude and see the time. Actually, trying to work. To fix the problem really seems to make them better, even I can't do it perfectly for them, I can't. Always do A Bola nays.	1
Um during one of my college internships. I was able to get an internship at my current company on an. To do a presentation where I was able to. Look at all of our gifts analytics an? Kind of mirror that with our competitors. I'm so I got to do a lot of research and I. At the end I gave a presentation to the vice president on to the operations management team. It came up with a lot of cool solutions and presented some of the problems and the way that I think we could. Resolve them to maintain that commitment to our gift. And that was really cool. So I know I had a positive impact they got everybody excited about working on these. New possibilities so I think that one of the coolest things where I was able to influence their actions.	1
I turn in which I was. Able to positively influence the actions of others. Was I have recently worked in clinics? And Unfortunately it was kind of a pain clinic so my doctor one day? So frustrated because of course, when someone coming in and they are in pain. And they don't even want to be there in the 1st place, the patient was being a little difficult. I'm so the doctor was kinda get a little frustrated an I suggest it may be that he come outside with you. He took a moment outside of what in the waiting room. We kinda just talk to each other about how he could handle this situation how he could see through patient, he realized really quickly. After being so flustered that he did need to just calm down take a moment understand that the patient was very frustrated. And it helps you alter his action so I believe that's a really good example of the time that I did come in handy in that kind of situation.	1
OK, so I was able to influence the actions of others. Because I am of every. Outgoing person you know that always likes to motivate and help others to kind of do better, so the situation, I can relate to it maybe? Situation at my current job where there was a quarter. Michael workers that were having a bad day and. You know was getting frustrated with some of the work and I was able to influence her and you know trying to help her out. And tell her that everything is. No, it's going to be OK and we can kind of work things out together initiated my hope that I'll be definitely able to help her.	0

And that means both me and my partner, said because were like Oh my God, we have email games coming up. Anyway, she had to play with a different partner and it's different investment, but Luckily like. When I'm sitting on the sidelines. You know, adding like my partner on egging her partner on and just supporting them like. That encouragement goes along way like. It's night, it's it's hard to play with a different partner. But like when you have that support system, there with you as you want during a game. It really boosts your confidence so you know what I did is just apart. My partner when I couldn't play on the sidelines. You know, let's go you know you'll get the wall, you'll get that. The The next time and. You know just the very long way.	0

One thing that I can think about where we positively able to influence the actions of others was a few years back. When I was working it within the customer service. I feel that one of the restaurants that I used to work at named Golden Corral so I wasn't in need for that position. And on a daily basis. Dealing with papers and now have different people that would come in and obviously getting to know each one of them. Individually was always one of our great things that we wanted to do each and every day to make them feel comfortable make them want to come back and experience. Or a service with us again, so there was a time when we had a few customers were not happy with. The. The taste of the food that was cooked and so they were going back and forth with one of our servers and I had just slightly. I told our server is look at the positive side if we are able to accommodate them and maybe even just asking what they like is prepared to prepare them. A fresh previously for them that that would immensely make them want to come back into our restaurant in. Maybe even bring in another group of friends that would like to enjoy eating at a restaurant so after that. Damn, the service to take my advice and they had offered the. They're often are countries that were that were there to bring them in a brand new plate of food that was freshly cooked for them. And after that, the customers actually returned roughly 2 weeks later, and they had brought in their whole family. So the agenda today, I believe that I was a positive influence. I was able to have on our servers. Because they only need our customers. Servants outstanding it. And one of them to return and it showed the servers that were able to make that change.	0

Doing nothing standing around waiting for someone ask you a question if you were actively helping them check out customers. Assist customers in the aisle doing online pick up words even if like the most mundane. Task that some people would think that's not a manager duty. I constantly I would do all that an. Everyone always wanted to close with me, I usually did clothing an everyday I get asked are you closing tonight. I need to think like Oh, Oh, God, they don't wanna they only closing with them, an actually it's because they loved working with him because he's got.

So I don't know just like telling everyone because we were downtown. I really telling anyone everyone. Please get bread and give it to just a couple homeless people give it to like a shelter give it to. Someone, who needs it. An I feel like that includes a lot of people to do stuff, especially because after I said that. More and more people started like gathering bread that they didn't need and said they didn't want and we ended up selling it to people selling it, too.

A situation where I had to positively influence a group of other people. What happened to be when I had to take charge of a group of teenagers. Negatively impacted about what was going on in their day and they were coming out of high school so. I had to develop a project for them to make sure that they could thrust forward in their careers. After they graduated well they were not happy about that, so I had to create something really fast and. I created a plan in a program to where they could thrive an also enjoy doing whatever they truly desire to do. Which is like I have one student who likes so I also like I also have one student who likes to? Do arts and crafts on the side and sell them for you know of anything and then that's basically.

Difficult for others to buy into me being someone from the outside coming in to a a business atmosphere. Weird they don't know me I don't know them. I don't know anything about that the job pretty much I wish is fresh off the street, said no too much. About what the job entailed in trying to get them to you know buying into what I have going on in to support me. In learning and doing different things. So basically I just have to be honest and nothing integrity goes along way. So with integrity. More than likely you get people to buy in what you're trying to do or you may have a greater sense of? Influence over them.	1

I'm influenced the action of others in many of the jobs that I've had. Over the years I once was Volunteer Fire chain and of course I had to give orders and commands. 2 members of the company and the rectum into extinguishing fires, and teaching him how to extinguish fires as well. Also, when I worked in the medical industry it was involved. With making sure that the South. Was trained and understood what they were doing and meta schedules? Talk to them about issues and problems that they have. And help them to correct the problems and change maybe the way they handle things or. Help them to get education as they needed.	1
Thank you.	0
The time that I was able to positively influence the actions of others. I'm I had a passenger who had fallen down. I'm not far from the gate that I was working at. There were several others that had run to her aid an other passengers who had witnessed it and then. A couple of my other colleagues as well. I immediately everybody was trying to touch her and move her. I had to immediately tell them to back away. And do not touch her we did not know how bad. She was she was an elderly painted elderly passenger. I'm very upset very confused. And I had to immediately turn to my other the other day, they can stuff is working with an. Have them called management and have them call somebody from the medical to come up and assess her. And she was fine. And they did we ended up calling an ambulance as well, just for extra precaution. But. I had to make sure that she was not moved we did not know what or how bad she was. Ann. In the long run, she was fine. We did call the ambulance entrance did come check her out. And then they gave her the the OK to be able to travel. I thought it was too late and then but we waited for her so just making sure she was OK was. What was with what was most important? And nobody touching her moving her. So that was one of the ways I had influenced my other. Fellow employees. To do the right thing.	0
At my current airline I currently work with. Other flight attendants and there have been a few occasions where the other flight attendants that I'm working with just. Don't seem to be the selling all of their responsibilities or. Maybe there are lagging behind one instance, where this happens with one of my personal friends. So I just feel a bit more comfortable talking to her. But I simply said. What's going on? Is there anything I can do to help you seem like you're? Lagging behind an not getting everything done that. You need to, and she just said. Oh, I've been having a really bad day. This stuff is going on at home. And after that. I feel like we really moved on, and the rest of the truck that we had together she. Head. More knowledge that Oh this is this was bothering me and we really were able to work together and positively affect. Or behavior for the rest of the trip. We talked about what was bothering her and she was able to. And to fill her responsibilities much better.	1

A time that I was able to positively influence influence the actions of others. Was when I was still working on? The Ram as a ramp agent for Delta Global Services. I come into work I was still working, the night shift in one of our flights had canceled. And so I wanted to see a counter and I came in around 8:00 o'clock 'cause I wanna schedule 2. Be there. And I saw a huge line of passengers and 40 or 50, maybe even more bag sitting. Hum. Sitting behind the counter, so I had gone back into the bag. And inside the people who were pulling bags off of the bag cards to bring them up to the passengers. I had gotten the other ramp agent, I was like I told them. We need to help them out there. There's 100 passengers and there's 100 bags and if we go out there and help them we can get everybody. Really need to go get them their bags back and help make the situation a little bit easier and. Once he got everybody out there. We were calling names finding people and giving them their bags and they actually explain to us how to? Destroy a bag tag in our system so that when they came back in the morning, they wouldn't have to. Paper that bag and 2nd time. And once we had everybody out there working together and getting people their bags and destroying bag tags. I believe that we have this situation. Under control and everybody was on their way to a hotel or back to their house whether they were leaving from. Ohio or they were returning to where they were from probably within about 1/2 an hour and when I showed up there was only one gate agent. Counter and after I've gone back and gotten everybody else, we had about 3 or 4 people up front. Helping passengers in assisting them in getting their bags. I'm getting them. Really needed to go and I feel like it made a lot of people happy and it definitely need to get agent happy because she had to help that she. We're definitely needed.	1

A situation where I was passed to be able to influence action actions of others. I would say currently right now, I am. Employed under an airline and sis situation is changed every day as far as cancel flights or weather for this particular situation. We had a cancelled flight for bad weather. And when that happens, you know the customers luggage typically are held and they want to reflect it. So the situation was a customer came down to our office. And their flight was cancelled in, she wanted her bag back. Unfortunately, it was past the deadline for your bags at a certain time with the airport closes at 10:45. Vicious workers they go home. So the action that I took to help her with this problem. I just kindly explain to her. Hey, you know, Unfortunately at this time. There's this change, you will not be able to request your bag until about 5:00 AM in the morning. On the customer was pretty upset. She was like I need my bag, I have my total cheese in there had. My Phone charger certain necessities that you need to spend the night at the airport when you're traveling through or connecting through to a city. So the action that's it for her. I let her know OK well. I do have 2 or 3 kids for you. And also let me go see if there is an extra charger laying around in the back. The response to this customer tips that she was very pleased that I was able to help her get the things that she needed that since she couldn't retrieve her suitcase. I believe she she respond in a positive way instead of you know being I rate as some customers could be or they could be angry. But the question was actually pretty happy that I helped her and help her resolve the issue. Even though she couldn't get her suitcase. There was another option for him.	0
There, when I was a correction officer. I I was in the Academy and we had some physical activities. To to do, and some of the other trainees had some difficulty as well as myself, I I did also have some difficulty. And doing some of the activities physically strenuous activities and. Positively, what I've done was that I kind of encouraged my my. Fellow correction officers future correction officers to work on, I I motivated them by you know, giving them good. Positive motivation and through my speech. I told him that you know you can do it and things like you know just. Try your best and keep going don't stop things like that words and I tried and that really helped. What happened the result was that that helped the other officers get through the course for the for the training? An I thought that I can if I'm able to do it, then I can motivate others who have difficulty in doing. Physically strenuous tasks an motivation really helps you know, even for myself. When I'm struggling it helps me when others motivate me. And people that I trust I have some trust in and that care about me and I care about them. And when they motivate me it helps me encourages me to complete the task and vice versa, so that was really. Interesting experience where I was able to positively influence the actions of others in in the Academy for Correction. For the New York City Department, thank you.	1

Most recently I had a situation at work, where one of my coworkers wasn't getting along with one of my managers. And the best thing, that I could do in my position, which was what I did was to take him aside and just kind of telling this ticket. And now we are at work for many reasons and that once we get through our shift we can go home. And it's no big deal, we can come back tomorrow with a fresh basil. Fresh ideas fresh mindset and not worry about the things that happened, the previous. We don't know what our manager was going through or what made her date not the best in me. The reaction that she had to a situation not the best so I think it's always hard to get somebody. The benefit of it now and it just shake it off and drive new day and you took that advice. We had a fantastic shift and now we go back to work later this week and hopefully the lab refresh rate that.	1
A situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others with a time where I was a server at a? Restaurant that was very busy in our restaurant was very known to help people who had specific allergies dietary restrictions.

The woman notice that there was cheese on her shower now Jesus Gary so obviously, she cannot have that. She's like me down. Let me know the problem. The first thing I make sure to do was acknowledge the problem. How sorry we were and then we're going to get this fixed for her right away I remove the salad from her table. I got it to this to the kitchen in the shaft. She then looked at the power he said. I'm so sorry about this. Let me take care of it for you and. We can get this out to her quickly as possible. I went back to the woman let her know that the cells of disease. We made for her from scratch and we wouldn't be 100% sure that there be no cheese on Top. Once the covered was brought back out. I let the woman. No please let me know if there's anything else, I can do for you. I'm so sorry about this and I really. Hope you come back because we really appreciate your business.

Voice recognition in as an offset for the Navy and I was a leader of about. I would say 12 other midshipmen in which I went the academic program for our program our VC program. In a way, which I feel is so I was able to positively influence those up. Is fine I had to make a? Pretty much the academic plan in which they get other students involved instead of making it like a study Hall type of situation. IPad everyone out with the Bunny and wish. They all were accountable for each other, they would help tutor one another. And we will also have games in which we would compete with one another to make sure that we're staying on how far I think they made? And then it made it less of a chore to do anymore, so fun and we had raised up. The overall students grades significantly by like I believe it was 10%. Everybody just degree shot of everyone was working together as a team. And making sure that they were taking accountability for one another. The result was very positive. Of course, as I said. Our scores were up much higher than what they were originally and everyone thought that it was a fun way to learn.	1
So I work with a lot of girls an there can be a lot of gossiping going on. So when that happened, I always try to tell one another to always just go to the source of the problem that there's a problem to always try to go to that person work things out because at the end of the day. You're going to have to work with that person and you rather have like a peaceful work environment weather than a work environment where there's a lot of tension, a lot of drama. And. A lot of chaos. So I always try to be the bigger person. An always help. Other People be the bigger person in this situation because at the end of the thing. Drama and complex is never good.	0

In doing is showing her personality and being able to give those athletes, a platform to express themselves. In a way that they are able to do during their time at school or they're kind of home. How to get from that statement so me being able to express my personality eventually instructor instructing them help but it can be. Answering then how you can put your own flare into it gives them the opportunity to do the exact same thing. One of the things that we do the most is reduced different classes. We really focus on time management, giving each class. About 30 or 45 minutes to do each skill and giving each athlete and coach sometime in between. Or water breaks and time to really bond with each other so being able to get them that platform. To express himself and give them time to focus on what they really want to learn I can't it kind of pushes. Ourselves as instructors, too, too kind of mode this camp to what that code for athlete want them to be.	0

What's happening keeping them updated on what's happening when they're in the recovery area, letting them know I will be sure, and let your family know that you're fine where you are. Give me an approximate time frame of when you'll be ready that type of thing, so we had a couple family members who were quite angry, which effects your reviews publicly. Or effect it effects your performance. Everyone just read on their performance. So it's important that you know when I have that I'm unable to go up and talk to the family members? What's happening. You know you're affecting told you what's happening with your family member. Let me go ahead, and check packages from cold water. Let me give me directions to drive around to the back of the building just keeping People informed and treating them like a human letting them know I'm here my name is Michelle. If you have any questions, you know you can come to me and I will do my very best to closest you even that helps even if you can't call the situation. It helps People to fill her to see.	0

I'm at my previous job, I was in corporate America for this company called last group. And then we had this project that was supposed to actually do when most of the associate's there. We have the right resources and everything they were actually talking about striking often out excuse me in regards to. Completing the project, however. Be advised there once you actually trying to do the project make sure that you are also able to multi tax. I managed to talk my friends into actually multi taxing an I'm making sure that all they didn't actually leave the project because. Is better to actually do some research and make sure that whatever you're working with is the best resources? Even though some resources were not provided but at the end of the day, we were able to actually multitrack and find our own resources. And complete this project on time thank you.	0
One of my favorite jobs was working in the restaurant industry and so I worked as a server for several years. And there were times where servers or different people that I work with weren't happy with the sections that they were signed in so it's action is based. Basically, how many tables you're going to be serving throughout the course of your nights and so sometimes if this. Serving and get a big enough section. They automatically assume that that meant that they didn't, they wouldn't make the amount of money. That they desire so one night, there were a few servers and they didn't receive the sections that they. And so. I decided to talk to them and figure out what was going on why their mood wasn't happy and chipper as usual. They expressed to me, They're upset around their sections. An I told him my philosophy and this in a restaurant that I worked in I was one of the? Talk to you girls are people servers and so my tip to them was that I realized that my. Energies determines how much I make not the section and he asked me what I meant and I was like. In short, it doesn't matter if I get 2 people every single time I serve a table or if I'm serving a party of 20. Is my NRG isn't correct if I'm not happy if I'm not willing to support them in the things that they need an or desire. To have a great stay at the restaurant, then they wouldn't treat me the way that I think that I'm deserving. Because of my speaking to them, they were then able to. Change your thoughts and have a different mood and at the end of the night, they told me that. They made a lot more money than they ever had in that one night.	1

It's Always filled out so when I continued to do was I asked her if she what was the reason for the item. He basically said that it was for anti aging for dark circles and she basically just wanted something that would. Pretty much even though he's been so, so I then proceeded to tell her there was an item that I used something a little bit similar. And I told her if she wanted me to go show her. I then told the manager. If I was able to get off the register. Am I perceived to take her to the cosmetics line. I'm sorry, the governments area and I showed her the product and I basically folder that I used it. Since I do supper with a little bit of acne scars.

Hi 800, I was able to positively influence someone else is I'm currently a manager at lifetime fitness in our spa. Area so I have particular stylus that I ended up hiring and after about a month of being there, I realized that she. Was not really pulling her weight on selling retail and going out and getting new clients. So I wanted to be able to. Not come across as the manager to a bit more of a minute or so I took her aside. Anne had a one on one with her and really went over in depth in on paper about one numbers look like where she could. Go in, she achieve certain numbers and ratios and really took the time to invest in her to maybe give her communication skills. To help her just put her at ease a little bit about talking to guess that come in unannounced that maybe aren't in there and they're just walk in. Trying to look at retail products and so forth so I really spent about 2 weeks with her sharing her. And letting her work beside me, trying to see how I approach people when they come in and went over all Phone numbers with her show her really broke it down in showed her where. She would be able to Excel even if she just sold one or 2 more products in the bath. It would show her where she would be in how much extra money that she can make at that time. So after about 2 weeks. I'll let her kind of go on her own and do that and then told her we would. Check back in after about 2 weeks. Which would give her a full month of kind of doing this whole thing 2 weeks with Me 2 weeks of her. And after about a month. We sat down again with her number and her number, said actually increased 50%. So it was remarkable that. Obviously, there, she increased that much, and that she was able to see the growth. And the smile on her face and just being her.	0

I was told to describe a situation where I actively influence. Others in a positive way so working at the hospital as one of the team leads you know, some coworkers have bad days and. Is that to me to make sure everything is done correctly? So I tried to sympathize with them and let them know you know. Every day is in a bad day or try to do small things to help them. I'm not sure about so one particular situation where I had a patient coming in or of employee come in. And here they say like not having such a good day and. You know which is she was already late so I feel picked up her work for help. Her out when I couldn't you know, let her know that you know, I'm going to work with you.

Being in the military there's a lot of different ways that you have the influential ability to get others to be motivated to get others to be in a positive state of mind. So working as a platoon Sergeant. I was in charge of about 30. Some guys and we do training very, very early in the morning, so you know, we're all exhausted and. I want to miss you know get all sleep is a lot of us are students. So basically it was 1 morning. And I'm in charge of PT on you know, I was kind of showing up rolling up at 5:00 AM and we're getting ready to start our five I'll run and. You know, I'm just kind of noticing a lot of the people are just kind of exhausted like not really motivated seem like you know they don't. I don't really want to be there, so I guess for me. I kind of just use my energy to help motivate people and expose them to you know once you do this workout and you know, do something that's going to help improve US. Physically mentally and repairs for all the other military training that we have so we get ready go out for that five mile run. I guess everyone still kinda like. I'm tired and just have asleep so we begin to run an I'm just I use this time, I'm leaving to run so I'm just using a different motivation. I'm like saying let's go. Let's do it, you know, we, we've got this. And so we actually started using cadence is if you don't want cadence is basically it's 8:00 PM or AM. Crime that you do when you're running to help motivate and get that get that Morales servers, having time and. Just using that aspect in being able to really just influence people in a positive way to get them to motivate. Christian stuff to help better themselves and influence in a positive manner, so that was a really cool experience and. I think that you know at the end of the line. Everyone seemed a lot more energized and a lot more kind of. Motivated to do the same thing next week or the next day because this is a you know a regular thing for military so that was really cool to see that effect on those people.	0
I was able to possibly influence the actions of others was during my time in the corporate travel industry. One of my coworkers had a passenger with a very difficult itinerary. She became very discouraged with finding flights for him as he had a 16 segment I sent away. I was able to provide assistance to her to research flights and find something that works for him to bed. And also stay within company policies. This resulted in a happy customer as well as a happy company saying that we were able to get him. So we need to go safely and in reasonable accommodations.	1
I would say a good instance of. Influencing influencing others in a positive way would be an A. Previous position when I worked at Walmart warehouse. It was, I was in a team lead position, the team that I had gotten was not meeting a right. And the the goal was that when they were supposed to. Be able to process 300 units within an hour, they were only doing a little over 200. I change the start meeting to enable others to get a positive experience at the beginning of this year. We would involve everyone I I was a positive influence you know to start with the meeting in the 1st place. Because of course, it starts with management so you have to be that the person that smiling and making sure everyone is doing things appropriately in the beginning. So we play games provided candy and I started giving out gift cards. Just to try and motivate an have inclusion within our our team, so within about 3 months. They went from a 200 rate to about 270? Which of course, that wasn't meeting the goal? But it was a significant increase so I would say that was a really good thing we had a lot of. Public feedback from our own teammates, encouraging others to help me write and clean the areas needed so I would say. That was a good experience as far as trying to get the team involved in helping make everything better for the company.	1
When I worked for a health insurance company a couple years ago. We had a very stressful time of the year, which is usually our annual enrollment, which takes place between. October in January and that's usually when most of our clients. We need health insurance benefits for their employees so as a health insurance company were very, very busy. And it's very, very stressful and sometimes team members would get overwhelmed team members that would have allowed to do lots of clients asking for. The same thing over and over again and frustration was gross so I made it a point a couple times to make sure that I would. Step in and help teammates anytime that I could and encourage every time that I could because at the end of the day we're all a team. And if one team members doing well, we're all doing well and it won't remember struggling around Sterling so. It was very important for me to make sure that I would make myself available to all of my teammates. And help them out and assist them in any way that I could for the benefit of our group.	1
One time in the beginning of my. What time in the beginning of my starting job as a busser at a hotel and the breakfast section? We had a convention for an agent branch. To have breakfast with us and there was about 200 people in like 5 waiters. All of my colleagues were like stressed and they felt like they didn't even want to do this before we even got a chance to start. But I said, Maybe if we just split the work up and put them in different sections and just. Try your best to make ourselves look comfortable and greet them an. Make sure they get their water there juice or whatever, they need everything will go smoothly and we will do a good job and have their customers. Pleased with our service.	1
There was a time that there was no patience at my job and there was nothing to do. So instead of sitting there, not doing anything I grouped up all the other amazing and ask him if we can. Actually, pack unpack boxes as well as. Fix the rooms and get prepared for the next day.	0
A situation that I was able to influence the response. The situation includes the actions of others positively is pretty much every day of my life. I live my life. My turn visible with integrity and always trying to do the right thing serving putting other place other people ahead of myself. And so situations, I remember um always trying to be honest, one of the things that my employers and my. My staff teachers wherever I'm involved they know that I am honest and survive me, setting the standard of being. Honest and having integrity and putting people above myself. I I influence other people to to serve to open the doors to put other people ahead. This these situations are. Every day for me. I've tried to be the most honest. And 4th right? With a smile being positive. I remember coming into work at six 6:00 AM in the morning with a smile on my face and. Everybody needs to call me something different because I always came in with a smile. No matter what we were to do? How much work how much that. I would stress comes my way. and I saw I saw how everybody around me started to come in with a smile. 6 in the morning when we were. Unloading packages or whether we were putting things on the shelves or we were serving customer service serving other people we did it with a positive. Teamwork aspect and so I saw how as actually knows a smile. Then everybody else started coming in with a smile. And I could bring peoples Demeanors peoples attitudes up to do a positive and healthy smile, an influencer day.	1
So I currently work at a law firm and I'm a legal assistant at that law firm and part of my duty, as illegal. Assistant is to get together exhibits whenever we have a trial coming up. So this one day we had a it was relatively large trial and we had about 20 exhibits, which meant that I had to go. Running it that's made and make a lot of copies for them and everything. So what I did was that I made sure that I made a list of everything that I had to do I also. Number the list in priority order and everything like that, and with being organized and keeping my task together and everything like that, I will be able to positively impact my. Coworkers because I'll be able to get my task done quickly and I was able to do the job correctly. And in time before the trial.	1
So a situation in which I was able to positively influence the actions of others. Would probably be the first thing that comes to mind is? Why was resident assistant at school? Oh. I have daily interactions with residents. But some of the more challenging ones. Were? More tense situations. Like for example, if I was responding to a complaint that it was a little bit too noisy. Often times that I had to do was. Deescalate the situation. But also My personal goal anyway. Was also always still come off as someone that was pleasant to interact with I never wanted to come off as? The harsh rule enforcer even though I always did my job. I personally never wanted to come off as somebody that was just. Sticking to the rules, not listening to anybody else is input or opinions. So specifically. There was one instance that I was. Requires to go break up a party in a dorm room. And the students there were. People I knew my personal level, they were my friends. Somewhere somewhere in. And the situation. Not to get into too much details we got a little bit out of control. But I was able to deescalate the situation. Keep representing the University well. Well still influencing the others in the room, too. Calm down look at things from a different perspective. And. Oh, I mean party was broken up at the end of the day. And everybody ended up having a good interaction for the rest of the semester. But I was able to change people's outlook. Just on a very brief interaction with them in that situation.	1
And empty. I get looked up to the by the public all the time and that little kid. And then I'll see what's the best part of my job. And it's taking lives some days, it's hard some days. It's Some days, it's great some days, it's hard.	0
Formerly working at the Garden State Mall eyes to encounter a situation where a customer and the cashier was engaging. Heated argument.

Or higher authority and that engaging a confrontation will not result in a great end. I influence the pressure as well that losing your job behind the argument is not going to be great. And also argue with the customer is not right.	0

Everyone sits behind on everything and everyone is just generally in a bad mood and sometimes I can affect. Except for gas experience, especially in here. Not only just trying to provide a service that hospitality so. I think. One of the easiest things that like I can do with the people that I work with. It's just kind of. Grab them for a second after that there's anything I can do to help and it's not at least give them a second. To breathe and just kind of taken the situation and make sure that. It doesn't affect. The gasket that's kind of the best. That's kind of the goal at the end time so just kind of being able to encourage others while also being on Top of your job. Definitely commuting positive and.

We have a great job. Here are great opportunities. To actually make money. And when you travel across the world, which I just got back from Dubai in Jordan. You understand that you know, not everyone is fortunate as us and you can keep your positive. Iti mindset and you can get through anything knowing that if you're happy your moods. I'm happy in those around you will be happy. As long as you like I said, keep that positivity mindset and remind others that you are way more fortunate than any other People around you. You know it's it's a very tough thing. A lot of People think it's so easy to be negative. Rather, if you just smile for 10 seconds will change your whole mood, depending on the situation and what your end. That's alright influence others and now just keep a smile on your face remain positive outlook and try not to dwell on the negative events try to grow from them and use them as a stepping stone to move forward and honestly enhance and be more efficient and what you are in your life, you worked your family in every aspect of life.

And the report was really, really low at one point and I feel like you know something came over me and I was just super excited too. Bring the group back together and how to remind everybody that we were here. So I started uh I pulled a group together and I said, Hey Let's. You know it all sit down living room and let's have a power after dinner, so after dinner, we all sat and just kind of December Cardean. Some of the challenges that they were going through to make their day, not go so great and you know. I think the part myself so just kinda remind everybody about some great moments that happened throughout the day will be 5 people. Calling or kicking up dust and we're just so you know full and happy and open with us and. I really do feel like I truly try to ship around and it made it was moving forward and. It was one of the best experiences I had in college for sure.	1
There was a situation and work where a number of people were complaining about another employee a colleague of ours. And. They were not really speaking behind most highly of this person not giving the person the opportunity to answer questions explain themselves. Somehow, I was able to what I was able to do, and my task was to make everyone. Get the try to get along So what I did is I said everybody is that everyone down. I said, This is really not. Fair that other person is not in the room and everyone is talking attacking this person. So what I did ask is we bring the person in. We sit down with them and we discussed the situation. Once the person was able to answer questions explain what the problem that they were having was. Everyone came to an understanding and the whole situation was defused. Everyone was happy again and we had a better time. At work.	1
So I work as an emergency dispatch operator for the larger largest monitoring company in the United States and I've been there for a little over 3 years now. And they have me trained the new incoming employees so I remember when I first got hired at my trainer made it very. And comfortable for me by just being positive and saying that you know you'll get this. You just have to try hard and you'll be OK so. Add new being a trainer now I try to make it as comfortable as everybody. But I have to I probably would have to train. I try to make it as positive experience that I can for them. So anytime I have a new training come on board. We I always make sure to try to make it as fun as possible. Make sure they learn all the rules if they're supposed to, but I try to do it in a fun way, so that way they feel more comfortable. And I every time I come into work all the trainings that I have. You know they always you know with a smile on my face always say hi to me. And I just feel like I can impact our company, Ann about her wedding by being more positive to them. And I think that's how I've influence people in a positive manner.	1
So a situation in which I would be able to positively influence action of others. I would say that when there's like a bad situation or something that's kinda negative. I was trying to like. Break the ice. So I would think it's easy to like tell a joke kind of joke around to kind of. Like you said, like break guys so like with my job at Starbucks is very easy, sometimes get frustrated if you can't make the drinks you like spill something. So it's not like that happens. All I try to do is just kind of like tell a joke like. I don't like it'll be OK and try to make people laugh. I think making people laugh definitely has a positive reaction on people. And it kind of just makes the whole atmosphere. A lot better than I would definitely rather work when everyone is like having fun and it's not like high stress situation. And so I definitely if something like that happens that's like my number one goal is to kind of like. Break the eyes make people laugh everyone, relax and then it just turns the whole situation to like a positive situation.	1
I'm so I used to be a camp leader for Duke Ministries and the children they would fight often and this one boy got into it with this.

Or you're standing incorrectly an I'll tell them. How they can? Improve their posture. Or improve. Doing there, sitting posture. And. I ask them for their feedback at the end and usually they told me. It's helping. And this is not will try something different.	0

A time when I was able to positively influence the action of feathers. I was or I currently am a limo driver at winning encore and we were going through a really. Busy moment where there was a lot of different guests coming out at the same time, we had a lot of cars lined up. Ready to handle that, but was a little chaotic and so I was able to. Kind of like charge of the situation and I I didn't take a ride and I. I sort of navigated everybody and made sure all the guests out in. It's hyper cars and got the drivers going with everybody. It was just chaotic and I think the drivers were. Kind of stuff they didn't know what gets to take they didn't know if the guess was actual qualified to take a car. I'm sorry I was able to get on the Phone with dispatch and kind of navigate that whole situation. And just got the guest out of there in a timely manner, but I think I kind of jump started everybody's attitude. I got them going 'cause again. Everybody was just kind of 2nd standing around so that was the time that. I think I influenced by the actions of others.	1
I've worked in customer service for many years and I've had many opportunities to do that. A lot of times I get an angry customer that will come up and they want their answer. Now they say once again. Now it should be done. But if you think of an alternative. You know like I can't do this for you, but I can't do this for you, you know. A lot of times it takes the hassle out of a lot of different things because they were satisfied. It makes everybody else satisfied it can make for a better environment because one master customer can. Ruin everything you know it could ruin. Just even an airline you know it could be. As a passenger. You get one rude person who wants to put in front of everybody else. Because he thinks that he's first for everything. If you just you know company then we just yeah, you know what? Obviously you're more busy than I am. I'll be happy to let you go in front of me. That takes a The QS part out of things because. I'm not hurrying she's in a hurry. And then everybody else behind me can actually. Enjoy their day 2 without a **** **** feel.	0
I think a situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others has to be in my teaching experience. I teach kindergarten and everyday I teach where caring and positive feedback and the results are in the positivity of my children in the actions that they expressed in their everyday. Life in our school.	1
Whenever the dining supervisor at Brookdale skyline. I had the opportunity of leading appreciates needing before each shift with a group of servers. I use this opportunity to go over the menu any rules and policy to make sure that everyone knew what they were doing. They were ready to go for the shift. They were in a positive attitude and move that we could all work together to get the cyst done faster faster ability.	1
So one situation, which I was able to positively influence action of others was when I was working as a flight line supervisor. At an FBO we had uh a large crew, but fairly new a lot of them are very new. A lot of them didn't really know how to really kind of take initiative or move forward in there. Daily their day-to-day activities. There they were kind of just sit and wait for things to happen and so I took. All of them together and try and told him that you know you shouldn't have to wait for something. To happen in order to respond to it, there's always something to do there's always. You know, some sort of proactive step that you can take like if we know an aircraft is coming in. And they are of a certain size of a certain weight or anything, you can press the equipment that we would need to service the aircraft. Or if you as soon as we get an aircraft in we should always be ready with a luggage cart. And things that we know that you know the passengers might need so that we don't have to sit there and. Wait, for them to ask us for the things that we are pretty certain that they're going to ask for. And just be more proactive in their day-to-day rolls at the FBO an I think that influence them very positively because we are performance improves from that point on. And I think a lot of the guys really appreciated kind of guidance in that way so they're not just kind of sitting around. And kind of wondering what to do or sitting around and and kind of not doing anything at all. And there's always something that can be done at work for sure.	1
I firmware I hardly influence the actions of others was Tom Rouse at work and there's a new product watching.

Hi my name is Tamera more and one experience I've had where I had influenced positively over someone else. Someone was traveling for the first time on an airplane and I was able to help them through their journey. They were able to get on the plane, they were very nervous, but they were able to save in the plane. And at take off. I was able to hold their hand and help them through their journey along their way to their destination. And so they were able to fly for the first time and it wasn't so bad.	1

A situation where I was able to positively positively influence their actions of others was while I was getting him. Newark airport for Scandinavian airlines. I remember there was a day where our flight was delayed over four five. Powers and there were a lot of passengers who were screaming and yelling and I took it upon myself to keep everyone informed and do the best I can and crime everyone down because. At the end of the day there's nothing we can do for till later translations and has never seem to know that it's. See now when it for weather delay. There's nothing anyone can do and getting nasty and having a bad attitude towards someone else is not going to fix the situation at all. And I always like to maintain a positive attitude with everyone with my coworkers with everyone around me, including the passengers.	0
And so. A situation where I was able to positively influence. Others situations and all that is one time. I'm very good at. D escalation. So I think I get that through my years of customer service work and restaurant where conserving and. All that type that you work when you work with the community and so 1 positive situation that happened is whenever I was working at Outback. My coworkers had a very difficult table and very difficult situation going on the customers were not responding very well and. Agitated and Just. Over it and so I've told her instead of bringing the argument back up and going back and forth with the customer. Why don't we think of a solution? To make us more happy and give them a positive? Like experience in our restaurants and so we created a game plan where OK if they respond like this. We will respond like this an I agree to help her with the table as much as she needed. Um. To maybe if I send something different, maybe they would receive it differently, and just work as a team. To accommodate these customers so they can have a fabulous experience at our restaurant and they don't want to come back and. EverQuest for her again. So instead of getting angry I recommended that we think of different ways of responding to their responses and their actions and. How they feel or felt towards things so I gave her a couple little tips on what to say if they were to say something like this, which is a normal response that we would get. From agitated customers. In her body language and how she was standing there and approaching them and it ended up being a great table. She got great his and they come back all the time. So I'm very I was very happy with that.	0

It was the most amazing experience in the best of all is that I got to lead those groups into doing this volunteer activities. We did things from like we dating to cleaning windows to serving homeless. Homeless people in the community and it was an amazing because none of us were from the community. So I was telling these kids and influence in these other people. So I go back home after the summer is over. Go home and do this like you can go to your local soup kitchen. You can go to your local homeless shelter and you can give. Exactly. Just putting a driving force of hospitality and like influencing others to just. Be good salads are rewarding summer and I hope that I positively influence those people to continue where they were doing that somewhere. Back at home.	1

Things at this hole in that way that we can encourage them to purchase it and at first, a couple of my Kodak server insert into the table IOM. Maybe not a good idea, and then I was there an? I've asked him why did they think that it wasn't a good idea and then they they would like? All that maybe it would not bring us, it and much money and then I thought well every little helps really so. At the end, that stay. Got my point and then and they agreed to go ahead and do what I said, so, so I sort of. Encourage them that my colleague to M. To use the technique that will bring a lot of money to occur. Please stay for that it wasn't too much. But that that is something at the end of the month end of the day. So. Yeah, so we went ahead and did it.

Examples being done by one of our vendors and she was so I read that she was using abusive language. The agent that spoke with her felt that she did could not get her to set down the nosh. And you have to understand that we will looking forward to helping her and why we, we will in limited in what we can do. We were going to do our best full so by doing so. She asked me to come and speak with a customer. I think the initial step was getting her to step back and realize that I was not the enemy. That I was going to do anything that I could help her with in my the boundaries of what the organization could allow me to do. But I did promise that the first thing I said to her. This is who I am my name is Heather Welch. I want you to write this name down. Anytime you want to speak to me, I will come out and speak with you. Because this is what I am here for to make sure that I can help you in anyway that I can.

I will try my very best to make sure that the vendors understand her knees and that she was in need of their systems together project completed. I think by me just identifying with her that I am who I am and what I can do and. Having that ability to contact me if she needed as I told her even if it was just depends. Please feel free to do so because that's what I'm here for to make sure that I can help in any way that I can.	0
A situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others. I would say is when I was a general store manager. Star called SYE. A lot of the employees. They just felt like a parser. We had to sell like we have to add on to the register. Magazine Adams and like a membership card in a lot of associates felt the pressure of having to sell those to the customers. Say it to do 1 on one training and if that incentivized out of my own pocket a gift certificate. For like AMC theater movies. So instead of making it like a vicious competition where they felt like it. They didn't succeed J would be. Written up or something negative stories like their jobs. I made it and turned it into something positive whereas. They tried their hardest and they said were able to add these add-ons 2 customers that they would be rewarded. With gift cards and such.	1
Hello yes, I am a manager at a childcare at the YMCA, so I'm in charge of a several staff members. And we sometimes have about 100 children, a day to take care of and I love taking care of people who love take care of children. But sometimes my coworkers have a little bit of difficulty just getting a little stressed out. So when I see that happening I'll just go over and give them just a gentle touch on the shoulder an? May I help my help with this situation, I see you're a little bit stressed and overwhelmed and then I just kind of showed them different. Things you can do to resolve the conflict from the Top down on. And just help them to know how to handle situations, sometimes people need to take a little break an. I just think teamwork is very important so as a manager. I just go over and I when I see my employees needing help. I just go over and make it a teaching moment. And help them to get through with the difficulties are working on and help them work. Through it, and then I have a little meeting with them later and. Talk about different scenarios on how if a child is crying different things that you can say to help them. The child is. Doing something that might irritate my employee. I just explained her how to take deep breaths how to understand you know. To deal with the situation to not get angry. Um. This is just this situation for a moment and we would want to be patient understanding and helpful and loving and everything that we do. So that's what I try to do to help my employees when I see, there having difficulties or if my. The women that are working in the nursery, I'll go in and. The baby won't stop crying. I'll take the baby from them let them have a little break so they can have a little breather. But I just think that's how it helps my company flow well is teamwork and just communication like.	0

With that company and it actually process to actually move offices and higher over 150 experts. Boys it was definitely something we were not ready to take on and everyone was pretty much scared going. This is something you change is definitely something that is part of lies and supposed to be a happy time, but sometimes for some People it can be a little scary so in this situation, it was a little bad talks about you know being scared to move and change. Locations and things like that, and I just pretty much made everyone feel comfortable just letting them know that you know change is going to come. You just have to adapt to it to the best of your ability and welcome each other. The same way that we work with these other we first tired in the company and it seems that everyone should grab eyes and it definitely is a good company to work for and everyone's happy with the decision that we made.	0

Out loud, no they don't need to room. An I said, I go. Coworker. I think they do need to room. Sir older couple an and then she was like no they don't. So I pushed her aside quietly and I said told the customer services. Please give us a moment and I had to explain to her because she is young, she's in her early 20s. And I wanted to explain to her when you get older. You know that more privacy as when you are when you're in your 20s early 20s early 30s. It's OK, possibly to share a room with another. Couple the favor like I said older and I wanted to explain to her like things changed when he did. Older and you have to be a little bit more respectful and understanding kind of like. Projector not predicted think forward is what they would do you think they would need at this age? And so I explain return and she went back to the gas customers and she said. Sorry and it was going to be no problem to get them to separate rooms. And in the end, the The couples are very happy and very gracious and thankful that they were able to get 2 separate rooms.

Cedar aircraft and everyone wanted to do something different than involves moving changing seats using the restroom. Had luggage so wouldn't fit in the overhead bin and then there was one that was wanting to get up and move around. Well Fortunately for me when everyone was converging into one spot. I kind of navigated them around and ask them of course, very politely. But the one I went to the restroom. I ask just to stay put. So when I had the mother that wanted to switch seats. The lady that was kind enough. It was gonna switch state that she would just have a seat after 15 year old daughter just to be patient for a moment I would be happy to get her mother back there just as soon as we got room in the aisle. And the person with the luggage of course I took the luggage. I put the tag on it, so that we can get it. She digs underground for cargas, however, instead of trying to encourage them to take it to the front. I parked it back in the back where I was so that we could continue hoarding. Everyone was very pleasant when I come up with the logistic waves and then I looked at the gentleman. I said, OK, now you can go from the bathroom. I got the luggage from the individual I moved it. Lady that wanted to change seats with the mother for the daughter. Everyone was happy as a matter of fact the mother was telling the daughter and she said. Did you see what she did?

I notice it was reflecting in her Phone calls and I don't want her to get in trouble. and I know that's not the person that she is. She's not typically rude person. She's always nice and happy so when Michael was done. I went ahead and put myself under loaded break time. Which was allowed? And it turned over for discussion with letting her know that it seems like she needs. You know just relax take a break and everything. And she needed she can go ahead and take a 10 minute. How long does she know that she has a certain amount of tennis actually turn takes is under the impression that she would? Only allowed the lunch and then the 215 minute breaks. One before, and one after I went ahead and educate her on this and just so she was aware that. We all understand is a frustrating job at times and that you can go ahead and take a break.

So when I was in the Navy at my job wasn't inflate technician an as unemployed. Technician my job is to fix whatever is broken on the plane. Whether it's before, during or after the flight just to make sure that we're prepared and so. Before the flight, we would we had an issue, one time where one of the critical equipment was down. And I had no other option. We had to fix that before we could fly, otherwise you wouldn't be able to fly. And the pilots were on us like we need to take off and either take off. And instead of just like jumping in there like OK well. You're in charge like let me just do whatever you want. I had to sit down. I had to calm red flame to the pilots like Sir. I'm really. I really apologize that we have to. You know the way the flight, but it's gonna take me 20 more minutes. Then, like to fix this piece of equipment and then we can fly safely. It won't break the entire flight and then we will have to come home early. And so I think that positively influence their actions to delay the flight 20 more minutes. Even though that's not what they wanted to do and that's not like. Actually, that's all anybody wanted to do everybody wanted us to take off and everybody had a lot of pressure on me to get the equipment working. Alright influence there. Actions to allow me to finish my job and to make sure that the equipment was 100% safe. Before moving forward because I wanted to make sure that during the flight and post light. I will going to have to. Either turn the plane around early or. Will stay all night trying to fix this piece of equipment in order to come back tomorrow to fly again. So I think that is where I really positively influenced pretty much the entire crew to delay the flight.	1

Just tell your recent scenario actually just that I had. I actually became a finance manager at Fillmore is pretty spent. Recently, about couple years ago. And it turned out that a lot of the folks who actually sales people that are working there did not really join in on the managers. You know weekly training weekly meetings that we would have on Fridays and Saturdays will be very quiet there would not be audible. They wouldn't tell us exactly what day would be tomorrow with their even their career goals were so I was able to actually go on because. This is something that I learned when I got into the business of auto industry that in order for you to achieve something you need to go ahead and get your goals and need to set some goals. So I was able to go ahead and literally sit down with each individual employee employee and trying to figure out exactly what they're looking to do with their life. And then you know, probably give them any kind of goals inside, one of the things that I used was smart goals. You know be specific are you reliable or you kindly can you measure your goals and then really sit down with them and go over that under regular basis to see if they were actually. Getting any kind of format, or if they were getting any kind of situationally ahead in that particular scenario. So I think a lot of the lot of the employees are actually with us. Two of them. Just recently became finance managers have to like I started talking to them about it. And then two are actually in in training right now for sales manager position as well, and cover actually taken going into the service drop but at. Start that over all that when I took the time to actually sit down with them and go over and what. How they can achieve things was even positive be better for them?	1

But they just don't want to part with, but on our aircraft. the C RJ700 there just a little bit. So on those. Playing sometimes we have to get check the bag because it won't fit and we don't want to jeopardize. The passenger safety by having your bags go. Under there underneath our feet and let's be put in an emergency evacuation situation. So I can remember, particularly one time where this passenger was very, very upset. She didn't want her name. What was in her back. But she was going to her mothers funeral. And she had to bring something out of that bag to her mother's funeral and she was really, really upset about having her bag gate checked. And so I I'm just thinking, I don't want her to get any more accepting Shorty is so I said, Ma'am. You know what? How about you take what's important out of that bag I'll take care of it for you as soon as we get through? Get you to your destination, we're gonna have that bag right on the jet bridge for you. She was still a little bit upset, but that's what we do in the moment and she was a lot more calm. After that, and I'm just very glad that we could have avoided something worse happening.

Hello I think. Time it's really since send out in my mind is when I was a. Do not let coach for Hilton Corporate. An I had a Team member who really she didn't like her job. She can see the point in only additions that she had to offer such as. Then frequent guest program and I just explained to her the way. That her actions would benefit the customer and to let her know that it wasn't just something that the company. Trying to do that there actually was a reason behind what it was and as a result, she wound up being. One of our best performers and ultimately ended up in becoming a development coach yourself, which is a manager and she said that the reason? She did that was. Because of the influence that I had on her that I didn't just say this is what you do this is. The rule and we'd have to do it. So I think that my actions by understanding the reason behind her. Hesitation in to do what was required. Is what really helped her understand? Where I was coming from where the company is coming from?	0

I'm so me personally, I used to do a lot of motivational speaking or kind of mentoring your wedding night. I'm index rating for the last 5 years and I used to teach people all over the world how they treated well. Had over 350 students and throughout my course of actually teaching on Facebook and through these times. I'm with day trading anything outside of the normal typical job. It's a string down the entrepreneurial path, it's not necessarily. You know show up and get paid you know just go through the motions and get paid a lot of it comes with personal development just having the right mindset in order to succeed. So what I would do is not only with you know, not not only what I study and analyze my charger. Actually be like be the role model with a front liner tag for the ready to actually attack the markets the financial market. What I'll do is I'll share my results with others from this way inspiring basically to ask me questions or. Ask her what are you doing, and then I expose other people to the financial world as well? When I do without mentioning on health and hold these people standing on it, too. You know that educate them on the matter. Of course, they have to want to you know to succeed, as well. When they actually go through material states, but basically what I do is. I do, I do the role model. I expose people to they don't mention holding hands and through guard duties courses and Whatnot. I've actually helped I know at least. 7 people make over $10,000 and I thought these people. Still, like I never even knew about. Or I was never exposed to and without me, making the first steps to actually pursue this path. So it's kind of like a domino effect. I started it and help other people succeed.	1
I was able to positively influence other actions by not only helping them in a situation every time I need. I also had times when. I had customers walk up to me and they would ask me. How do you feel about a product? How do you feel about this? I have an issue and I would tell him best my ability as well as best my attention as to what I see. There was a time when a customer asks me excuse me, I have a question I said yes, ma'am, she said. There's a gentleman here being rude. I don't know how to handle this, I said, well, ma'am, we do have? Surveys on the bottom of my receipts that you can fill out and you know answer. These questions and they will also ask you how are employees did? She understood what she had to do I gave her the information in my bosses Phone number and she definitely.

Well, most recently, I would say there was a situation with my. Current employer so real estate. Or property management, we were taking over a property of almost 400 units. And we showed up to take over on the 30th of the month. Um. We were not aware that the residents were not notified that there would be a takeover so it was. Kind of a hostile environment for the first day during the closing of the deal, um. Being filled with the 30th of the month. People were coming to pay rent. The online portals were down. They do not recognize anyone in the leasing office. It was you know a very difficult time I was able to come in. It was my first day and I was able to speak with a lot of the residents. I'm just reassure them. Everything would be fine. I said names numbers email addresses anything to kind of get the more comfortable with the takeover. Hum. And it just really worked out. It really worked out in the long run people felt more comfortable knowing you had a point of contact. They could you know call if they had any issues. I also provided my email and was able to respond in 24 to 48 hours. To a lot of the people who again were unaware of the issues. And it really just worked out and set the tone not just for the residents of the property that we were taking over. But. For my colleagues as well. I notice that a lot of them did the same thing just took a lot of contact information. An which is able to really. Hum. Keep everyone calm and keep saying, You know positive for the day because we understood their frustration and everything worked out well.	1

A situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others. This when I was working at a retail company and I was surprised manager so I was able to go.

Always put out their price changes and I finally you know how to call a meeting one day too. Employee of overhead management. And you know trying to them, the importance of being able to get these prices change because sometimes we were shooting. The concert and sometimes we were cheating ourselves. An no company can run you know, effectively by doing so, so you know once I explained to them 'cause. He's A lot of times were younger you know kids that were at you know in high school still so I had to explain to them. These processes in of course, work that was done by clubs went off and everything in it was strange that they were able to understand better. What their job required and then you know expenses they were talking us as well as the customer so?

There was a lot of negativity surrounding that whole situation. So being a positive person and having a poison com. Structure during the whole situation was one way to be positively effective during the whole chaos that it could become. Passengers were irate passengers were stressed, but we were stressed, but you always have to remain calm and keep a smile on your face during the whole situation. So no one freaked out, no one tried to cancel no one got. I write to the point where we had to call airport police so. Definitely keeping a positive attitude during that whole situation was. Positive action I took during my last job for sure.	1

So a time when I was able to positively influence the actions of others was as I'm across coach. There's obviously multiple times where? You have players who can either get down on themselves or when there are times where we're celebrating so much victory. Sometimes we can sort of lose ourselves in those victory. And a time that that happened was actually this past year where my girls that I coached for. We actually went to the playoffs in one of our lacrosse games and. Everything went great warm up with amazing practice is amazing. We trained and trained and trained and we were so full. Like we were so excited ecstatic to be in the in the position that we were in to be able to go to the playoffs. Everybody was just. Extatic. When we get to the playoffs and. There was a time where? It was one of those games where one was filled with bone after another. The game is getting out of control and my girls. Did start to kind of lose? Their momentum. And they started getting down on themselves and kind of. Pushing back each other, we at this point we're down by 3 points and everybody was just kind of losing their momentum throughout the whole entire game. And it's approach to be half time. And I kinda just have to take a step back and say, Hey look. This is what's happening right now at this point at halftime. We're at were down now by 4 points. We can either look at this as a loss and choke it up and we can all kind of. Go home but that's not what I want and I really hope that that's not what any of you girls want. As a coach like I had to do I had to do whatever it took for my girls to kind of you know, see the potential that they really did have. And not let them get so down on themselves and so eventually we kind of push each other back up and. We ended up winning the championship game, and we went to States and it. We didn't win. But it was the best experience that we had where we were able to push each other up.	1
A situation where I was able to positively influence the action of others would have to be when I was working on American Airlines at the gate. I was working with a colleague of mine who didn't seem like they're having a great day. Didn't seem like her normal self. I knew something was wrong and I didn't know what it was and you know, we got the flight out on time. We. Did our job I notice that she was a little bit distressing passenger asking her questions and she's normally very? Happy and you know, having answering questions so with That being said, I thought to myself well rather than say. Hey, what's wrong. I was you know, I said, Hey. Let's go get something to eat. I'll buy you breakfast you know. We went to go eat after our next flight and say, Hey, you know what's going on at home? What's going on? And it turns out that her son is very sick and she wasn't having a good time you know coping with Maine. And during that conversation, I you know, I was able to say. Hey, I notice something an I think at that moment. She was just like have you noticed that in the past? And she's all about her job and with That being said. I feel that you know being able to take her out, not put her on the spot ease into it. It changed reaction to the rest of the day and it just took a simple going to have breakfast. And talking about things to make the day so much easier for her.	0
One situation where I was able to positively influence actions of others was when I was working at the airport. And you know the flight was delayed everyone was very upset you know they've been waiting all day I felt. You know really bad for everyone, so everyone was. You know very, very upset. I'm sorry. I took it upon myself, You know to go and buy some candy by some board games. There's a lot of people had children. So you know, I was kinda just like you know what let's just have fun. You know, kind of take everyone's mind off of the fact that this light is gonna be delayed. And so my boss was he was very happy with me that I did that and took the time to do that to make everyone happy. Um because everyone was very, very upset you know you know just acting very negatively towards our towards my supervisor. And so I was able to positively influence their actions by you know, kind of distracting them and getting them. To have fun and play games and just kind of laughing. You know the plane will be here soon. Ann. I definitely did get them to act a lot more positively than they were acting before so I mean that was one time it was a great time so.	0
So there I was apart of. A group here at my work. And during the Holidays, everyone gets to pick a certain. A group or Committee that they want to donate to so when you reach a certain amount of volunteer hours outside of work. You're able to donate a certain portion to an organization that's what I meant so I gathered you know some. Of the people that I worked with and. I told him that I thought would be a good idea. If we all put Oliver volunteer hours and all of the money that we accumulated together so that we can make 1. Big donations to a organization of our choice, which is really exciting because we were able to donate a lot more. And we all were able to work together to. To to come up with. An organization that we all thought would that we all enjoyed in the way I thought it would benefit. From our donations, so that was one time where. Hi. Organized something like that.	0
Lastly, we have that we have been given in a project in where. But the vehicle center way to contact him.

So, in my job, I work with a lot of people who. Coming for many different use a lot of it is mostly like. Frogs in other things, so one time I did get this one lady who said she had just got. Our surgery done and people very uncomfortable and I tried to make her feel more comfortable. I told you sometimes it is very hard calling. Through. New changes in bras in sizes, but I mean, I just kept talking to her daughter was Alright. She felt more comfortable accident in the city room, we could. And Yeah.	1
Steelers this time at the coffee shop where I'm working at the airport. We're in we have a Korean our customers. And then She doesn't know how to speak English properly so. My other coworkers are very says we're having a hard time so I talked to her in a very, very. Slow manner. And I tried looking at her eyes and then. We understood each other. So the situation. With updates properly and then a coworker started in. They told me that. Oh, that's how you talk to someone who doesn't speak the same language. You just have to look in their eyes. And try to understand what is happening and then try to update the situation and try to help. As much as you can and. Yeah, that's how I positively affected their attitude towards the customer who cannot who they cannot understand properly. So I think that now. They'll be more uh. Maybe more basement with someone. Who can understand the English language?	0
The situation that I was able to positively give an inference to others would be at my job earlier. I'm work around a lot of people and I have some are service industry and a lot of people. I think come in and is very unhappy an not not in a good mood. So I think that my exuberance. And my positive iti always give them my smile or reason to continue and to be happy and they will change their attitude and by the end of our shifts there, smiling having fun. And doing what we learn together.	1
We had a catering order for a hockey payment in North New Jersey and I just told my fellow courses like. This is a big opportunity for restaurant.

It comes to us so that food.	0
Well, I guess the time that I was able to influence others was actually serving people. I'm having a server for 30 years an? We had a group of people coming who are quite cranking and displeased. Ann I was managed to defuse the situation by accommodating them. With what they needed what they needed was handicap assistance and I got a few of my team members at my job to help with this situation. Single stage, they had a wonderful time and that was it could have been a bad situation. But everything went out OK.	0
I have positively influenced my coworker in many ways, including uh you know, helping out with them with their situation. With a customer. I never used. Whatever had to offer. And. It worked for them. I do believe that any kind of positive iti that you can bring to your workplace is a good thing to do. Uhm I encourage it and I believe in it.	0
Well, as a ticket counter in a gate agent often during all scheduled operations situations, you encounter people who. I'm not going to discuss this fashion, so they're not very happy about that, so often. You have to. Get directions to a person. OK, so for example, when the last also go up oraciones. Person was being to get to. An international destination and because they're playing at a delay, obviously in the. Start process that she would not be in his. Connecting flight on time. Actions to make the next slide. So we can take it as quickly as possible, and then boarding passes for the next slide and likely password and getting on his way. And he made his flight on time because there was another aircraft. Kay, Lenz. Connections to Chicago on time so he came out. He was angry. I gave him some options. We haven't changed. Final destination account, So what kind of turned into a horrendous situation. Internet being underpaid situation and he said that nicely. Give me a fact for keeping a cool head in an awful situation.	1
Describe the situation in which I was able to positively influence national borders well when I used to work at. Long concrete. It's at Hocking Company. Oh. I was working and it was really hot, it was like 100 degrees outside in Dallas, TX and. All of my coworkers retired but they saw me that I kept working. With my hard working and things that I have and all the energies that I have an even if it was hard to get on. Going still kept on pushing because. When the dancing, it, then then it means interesting it down you can start to take breaks or anything. So, whenever they thought I kept working this on my drive. I got promoted to like a team leader of a group. Of laborers Flyers find the jobs and tasks for laborers instead of me being the same as myself so. I will I got promoted to senior Ann? Later on based on my care, progressing in the company so they started to push harder work harder. So my actions influence them. Fine. I guess I'm motivated and because fact anywhere in life that they wouldn't work hard hard enough, they will just do the bare minimum. But by dancing media promoted and pain increase, and all of that and me, giving him advice and motivation and they would not be able to keep on. Striving for success no matter where they go and what job it is to always be thankful that you at least have a job. So. Those actions of minds and the words that I gave them really helped him out.	0
I recently opened a restaurant in my background sound hospitality and management and I recently opened my restaurant in Denver, Co. It ran from 2016 into 2017. At the end of its purchase of a little under 2 years and what was her fantastic what I loved was mentoring the young ones. I'm showing them what customer service really was. It is an art and you really have to think about the person in front of you everybody comes to the table with something. That they did dealing with and. Even if it's a hard situation, even if somebody is not you know showing you kindness what we really focused on an what? However, reviews came back where was our amazing customer service how we loved everybody who came through that door. An I lead by example. I was always upfront and I wanted to be the one to show them. I think modeling. Alright customer service and behavior is so important, especially for the young ones today. And so just taking that extra time with the customer really getting to know them using their their name. And finding out a little bit about them. It doesn't slow down service, but it allows you to make a connection. And it's all about connections and that's what I had figured out over the years and so I think we influenced quite a few. Young people and that was really important to me to share that with him.	0
Oh, this was not one of my previous jobs and it was closing time. And it was a hectic day because you know it was a big rush throughout the? Today and we basically work the whole day, an at the end of the day. Everybody was tired and they really didn't feel like continuing then closing the store and you know. I kind of gave him a sense of you know like Hey guys, you know, we made it this far, you know. Hold it in together and let's try to get this store close as fast as possible so you know, we could go on with the rest of our day. You know, some of us could go out and have fun after or?

A situation where I was able to positive influence the actions of others was I can recall. Waiting at the gate when I worked in American Airlines. I had a coworker who was working the podium that. Wasn't having a great morning. She's usually a great agent and I can just tell by how she responded to people. And or passengers and how she would just talking to the cruise that you know something just wasn't right. And you know, I don't know if she was aware and not type of person that would just go and say, Hey, you know. What's going on after the flight was out. We are a little bit of a break you know, I was able. This is saying we should go get something to eat you know, I would buy a breakfast and you know. We went and had breakfast and you know, I was you know more interested to see what was going on. Outside of work because normally you know what happens outside of work, sometimes comes into her and this was with something that. What is typically not done by her so? After speaking to her that morning, you know, she had issues with a child in the hospital and you know. Some stuff going on at home. And after just hearing her talk. I think that's all she really needed was somebody who listened and somebody to care. And somebody to understand you know. Where have lives outside of work and with that you know they will say. Hey, I just notice that something wasn't right today. And I think I clicked in their heads that you know. You're right and. We were able to do the rest of the day she was like, she was 10 times better than her normal self. After that, and I feel like you know without that talk. You know, kind of led to complaints discipline something that all she needed was a friend to talk too.	0
There was a situation where I was in. Line at the airport at a ticket gate. Podium regarding a delayed flight. Um having worked in the airline industry. I kind of know behind the scenes a little bit how. Information doesn't always pass right through to the gate agent. People were upset about the delays that were happening. They marketing information and as usually happens and took it out on the gate agent. I actually voiced my opinion that it's not her fault. She's doing the best. She can to get us. The information in a timely manner. And as soon as she knows something. So let us know. So we need to take a step back take a deep breath and as soon as she knows something. Well, No. Um. The tone of the people. Changed an I think. Calm down a bit so the situation was defused people weren't so angry. I think they just needed realization, check to realize that it's not the gate agent's fault. That, they're working on getting this information as soon as she can. So that did diffuse the situation. And as soon as she knew something we all knew things were calmer and things were quieter around the gate.	1
It would be nice for your customer and ask if there is someone ask you about the question you have to ask. On Top of that, if you don't know you have to ask your supervisor to try to try your best to answer. Any question when they ask you.	0

Let's just go have a good time at the best of it, so I'm putting a smile on the passenger space. Wear something that I did, and I notice that other officers. All you know got along and decided to give happiness as well. So that's one of the things that I really enjoyed making the password to a comfortable and having been like you know have a good experience.	0

We had a group meetings with our supervisors in our team members and our supervisors. Asked what can we do. To make our job more to get our job done more efficiently and more quickly so I simply make the suggestion. In our told my coworkers, not to add any additional work to our already everyday tasks. But for the small tasks that we could do ourselves such as. Holding out account there a lot of small tasks that we could do that. We've necessarily don't need our supervisors. Or. Supervisor sat down and looked at those tasks and to this day, we have task now is team members that. We can do without having to wait on a response from our supervisor or response from someone in India because we deal with a lot of difference. Different countries in different states horse has that for tax to get during that we can simply do in 10 minutes. So to this day our supervisors found a method in a way for us to team members to take on. A little more responsibility. In adding on maybe five seconds of our work in. We are able to get our work done more quickly more efficiently with the method that are recommended for the supervisors.	1
A situation where I had that I could possibly positively influence. Others was whatever I just started working on the left side water dentures. I had a lot of trouble understanding.

A little bit misplaced. And so forth so we do a lot of different types of activities outside of the the home or. That we do it in that way we get to go out and being influenced them so that we can teach them. Things in the world world like doing accounting processes.

As a former flight attendant for United Express, their would situation that happened in the cabin on the way to Canada. Um. All the air mass came down.

Be scared of the situation because it was just a little malfunction that we had to you know divert back. My action as incoming other people down just started to. Reflect on other people who are trying to help me out with the whole situation so you know, knowing even though the flight attendant at the time.

To describe a time where I was able to positively influence the action of others was my time working in the hotel. At the Best Western in Scotts Dale. There was a time where in October that there is a agility dog training. And although it was very early an an hour before breakfast open. We notice that all of the guests were going outside with their dogs and with all of their equipment. And looking rather hurried and we asked if there was anything that we could do to help. So they said. Well, we have to go get something to eat and get to the venue. So I went back into the rest of the crew and I asked what do we have ready? What can we set up and what can we provide for them? Essentially everyone was able to empathize and they went out and talked with them and ask them what they might have wanted that we have off the breakfast buffet. So they were able to gather to go boxes and in a very excited and to provide that customer service. And putting the shoe on the other foot. We made hard boiled eggs. We make fruit yogurt juices and coffee for them to take and then we also did that for the rest of the time that. They were there. But everyone left with a very satisfied feeling that those people left happy and not rush. That's how we were able to where I was at least able to communicate to the rest of the team. And we provided that customer service, thank you.	0
There was a day when I was working as a server in a restaurant. We were getting beating. And me, and my coworkers, we were trying to Take the table and the tape serve the table as fast as we could however some of them started there. Getting nervous because we were having so many customers at the same time that we wouldn't be able to take care of them. Just by over S so I encourage them that we if we split the tables and we tried to help. Each other, it would be better, so that way. No one would be waiting for it and then we could. Work as a team, so then they got it. They took it very seriously. The opinion that I gave it to them. And then we started acting as if we were a team, so that way. Everyone would get the service that they deserve it.	1
I was once able to. Start a routine where I handed out letters to my customers and they were just are motivational letters that inspired positive iti. And it seemed caught on within the office and everyone was handing these little letters out to our customers and said to have a great day or it had a positive message on it or something personal. And it really inspired positive iti in the workplace and influence others to do better for our customers as well.	1
Hawaii. And we have been able to influence. Others is by the following. I've actually been in plenty of leadership positions. In previous positions and I've taken a lot of leadership and mentorship classes. And was able to. Do amount of knowledge advancement career pathing. Staff training to you know what I mean get clients. Or S members too. Respond in a way that they needed to when providing customer service in the services in a way that. Was? Very helpful the way customers wanted it again. Just being there as as part of a team in collaboration, but being able to mentor staff members that reported to me. In a way that. Get back to the business and helped. Still, there. Consistently. Thank you.	0
I have certification to be a substitute teacher, and every day, you have an influence on. The young minds that you are in the classroom with so positively I. Worked with pre pre kindergartners, which are between the ages of 3 and 5. Interacting with them showing them new things and just seeing the. Impact that you have on them daily with the knowledge that you're giving them and interacting with them was. Always, a positive situation knowing that I was able to bring them. A new sense of perspective and bringing them a positive image into their life. That was just something that was very rewarding knowing that they would go home and say. Look what I learned today, Miss Christina showed me this today, and knowing that they're going to take that out into the world. And that is something that I believe it was a very positive impact.	1
A situation where I was able to positively influence the action of others. Would be when I was working at a retirement home as an activities director. And you know, everyone who I was working with. Definitely wanted to come in and do their job. Even get paid for him and you know they didn't understand what I was doing so much later, doing all these things. Where in my job description? And the simplest way for me to play with you know treat others the way you want to be treated. Treat Someone Like You would want your mom to be treated your dad recreated brother and it really did sort of. That's how people? How tall are you know they're more willing to step in and just saying it wasn't in their job description? Because they want someone to do that, for them or for the parent or brother and I think it just it. Really sort of adding a lot of energy you know, people started to feel like. They were working. With their families supporting 40 to 50 hours a week, you know they were going in their second home. I think that that changed how the presence felt and how everybody sort of felt in their position for the better.	0
Yes, I did turn it right now and we had a bunch of delays one night. And there is an autistic kid on board. Another budget and it was very nervous and the mom was worried about the situation.

Max and rings just to make sure that he was comfortable and understanding what was going on and that we were trying to help the situation as much as possible to get us. Back to get him back to his home.	1

Uh I started hanging out to other people in this you know started picking up trash with me and said she began this huge thing is like? Right but then people. Is all picking up trash and then we were just you know cleaning up the beach?	0
So a situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others. This happens, often in the workplace that I. Currently work in a lot of times there are. I guess you could say I rate situations and um there's times where we have to. Take into consideration the time management and what we have going on and. Um sometimes Super. Given their place in line and in that case, it's a. Good thing because they were able to. Calm down the situation a lot better and give people opportunity in an? Just keep the peace in the environment and that's always a good thing when. There's always a fast paced movements and things like that.	0

Teaching experience and employee engagement, so the first thing I did when I started with the company is really get my team too. Gather there's a lot of processes coming forward that we need to change one of the things called point of service collections. So I had to get all the team members on board with the new processes and changes that we needed it take? To take forward we got everybody together in a huge team meeting and we made a very positive by bringing snacks and. 2 then really explaining the why this process has to be changed. Of course, there were some numbers not really into the to the change the time they've been there for many, many years. And really trying to show those team members. You know if we take it this way, then it can help the patients, even more. We can expand on the patient experience. An and show them the why explaining the why excluding the process to this will be much better than we currently have those an older system. An older model after we showed them and got their feedback and where the team members are able to. Demonstrate and also give what they thought we should change too, and put those in place and it became very positive for them, they felt like they were being. Her and of course, that food in the snacks itself was great because they love to eat. And the end result was it went wonderful the purest collections drastically drastically increased over actually 50%.	1
I recently had a situation where so I work in Hospice in hospital where a family member wasn't really. Sure, about. Just getting care for the patient Madison. I just feel like the main thing to do is really to explain before you go in and try to do.

Everybody understand what's going on and I think it works from here? I'm really excited.	0

Given the feedback, he might originally purchased. So. Or the other 8 prime numbers were trying to deal with the situation and until they came over to me. They said the passengers very late we already closed the cabin door. So then I said, OK, so we're not. We don't have to see for this passenger don't tell him no right away. Because then he feels as if you guys are not doing anything so I'm glad you're gonna have questions but you're going to look for it. Allusion that you're going to find you know, let's let's see what we can do for this after you know. He had the reason to be upset. He was he purchased something a service that he's not getting. So. It just worked out just like that, they don't remember winning for the passenger and told him. It's been a weird one 'cause I just pulled we had the door closed already. We will try to you know get you a seat with a little more legroom, or even if there's an empty seat next to you. So the situation and there have been a very popular with the passenger was extremely happy.	0

Hello. I used to work with events in my country and one of the essentials about global warning well as you know our planets is being really affected with all our actions. And during this the event I could explain ways to help with what we have that won't valuable for us as our planets. Right and I showed ways of recycling because in my country is not really common like here in the USA. I show way to help with trash in the streets because in Brazil is really common sluice slopes so. People even die with that. That's really seriously in my country and I hope I couldn't. Influence positively people that they stop doing all this bad things because that's not good for anybody and another event that really was really remarkable for me. Was about animals well i'ma animal over so it was about so my dogs? Or text Adele. In Brazil, you see a whole lot of abandoned dogs in the streets alot of Kitties in the street and that's so sad. So we kind of. Gave them a tour on the shelter to show them ways like how the dogs are how the dogs are treated. Why you gonna buy a shirt and a job to make somebody really happy and also it's really seriously that some people. So that sell dogs those treat them the way they deserve to be treated animals are living being just like. Everybody else they deserve to be both treated so I believe that I've influenced positively people in this both events. That was remote.	0
The situation in which I positively influence the action of others was at my current job, had so planetarium. When I was hoping plans Black History Month. I work in a building where diversity isn't always present for prevalent an I had to plan out an entire month. Black History Month, long event. And it was me taking charge and taking read which had my fellow coworkers who really trusting me and this truck. Actually led to them going out and finding amazing sponsors and partners. And just how amazing group of people to come in for Black History Month, which in the long wrong actually lead to. My coworkers being able to plan other month all by themselves months like Friedman Latino heritage month without my help or guidance. More leadership roles, they ended up doing all of that by themselves, then definitely something that's really important to me, so the fact that they could go out. On their own know what they need to do to include everybody wishes truly amazing and. I think all the moments when it's about went really well.	1
I was previously employed at T-Mobile. And one of the Main. Goals for T-Mobile is to recruit or have new customers. One thing that I did that I notice that. We didn't have as a company when joining was. A uniform set of. How to rate plans where and how? Gnu gnu employees would be able. To assess Will plan and rate plan that everyone was able to be eligible for so one thing that I did. Was instead of just working at my store as an associate? I went to my district and actually my region and show them a quick format and did a spreadsheet for them, so that we could all. Had better results, which resulted in better customer service. Better results for. The customers of course, 'cause they could see everything and understand what was going on. And just the environment that we worked because we didn't have other employees hesitating to work with other customers. So I feel like I bring. Great deal. Our organization. And just to be able to be organized usually influences others to have a more positive outlook.	1
At my current job right now, we did have a situation as a team member when we were not. All performing at the same level, meaning we were assign a specific task and he seems like not everybody was putting in the same. Effort, but we conversate than just putting input into the theme just letting him know. Yes, I kind of understand. You may not be as well for this person they may not be putting as much input but I absolutely agree. That maybe we can find him a different task. Maybe we need to sit down and have a conversation with this first thing. I'm I'm just a team player, so I absolutely believe that when things are not going so right. Let's just talk about it. Let's conversate. A team player is not always going to be a positive environment. But if you communicate we can absolutely make the best out of it. And that's where I do in this situation.	0
When I think of a situation where I was able to positively positively impact others. I think about my job. And career as an interventionist with the public school. We have a lot of new employees.

Well come to a situation where I have possibly. Influence somebody into Keys I can't remember the question right now. Is it would probably have my current job my job being a? Commission based job in many instances, many employees. Have you know suffered the consequences of not having you know working 40 hour shift and not actually getting paid for it? Due to the fact that I've worked there for about 3 years now little over 3 years and I've experienced several. Different scenarios, I've taught them or explain to them how to better use their time and how to manage. Or talk to clients differently in order to be able to succeed at this sales process that we have to go through. From it's a difficult industry, but it's definitely a very. Monetary way of. Succeeding in life and since there is no limitations to your income, but it is. If somebody is used to in hourly rate, it is. A little difficult when you begin in this industry.	0

Everything in multi task to push through and get everything that was in need to get done. And we did that. So that's definitely aware I influence others.	0
So a situation where I was able to impose the actions of others at work is where I was. Actually, working for a company and we were doing a project and the project consisted of outreach and we had a couple of different. Employers or employees excuse me back were nervous or they were. Nicholas they went out. It's applied to be able to influence others to join the team what I actually did was. I gave him a credit card I was able to. Give them some tips and some key points on exactly how to step outside of their comfort zone and working actually seeing me. Getting out of my comfort zone and being able to be comfortable on with the outrage, we were able to successfully. I'll be able to teach them exactly you know how to get the job done. And I was able to let them be confusing let them follow off of my weed and see that. It could be done and also honestly that if you are a good influence or if you are a good leader. You could have any impact on anybody to be able to live out their full potential.	0
Well. Doing now working period where somebody is doing getting the job done being a good customer service. I will. Positively influence them by. Saying.	0

Within my current position at my current organization, I am the floor leader. Like it's called before leaving I'm just sorely. Therefore evacuations and there's been several times when we've had where they? Maybe new employees or tenured employees where they don't want to perform before evacuations for various reasons, mainly because they think they're stupid. However, I kind of like go around and you know tell them Hey. Although it may be a tedious task that needs to be done in the event. We actually do it free as an emergency. And to be perfectly honest with you, we have experience in emergency where we did have a small fire on our floor and we did actually have to evacuate the 10th. Or so in that aspect. I think I've made a positive impact because I made my my peers in my colleagues aware. On the importance of actually taking these evacuations very, very serious. It's not a joke. It's not a laughing matter at all. I might actually when I worked at a previous organization into his situation, there where we actually had to evacuate in real time. Because it was a small for fire so that was a time where I made a positive impact on positive influence. On the actions of others because after that, they began to take the toy that before jewel very serious.	0

So, in college. I was on the rowing team at Vanderbilt University and I was a coxswain, which is essentially. Anne at leadership position, it's your acting as the coach when the coaches and around and it's your job to organize. The people in the equipment on it seems you're also in the boat kind of leading the rollers on. And so one of my jobs was to to help my rollers with their rolling skills to kind of look for when they were doing something. On. You know that maybe they could be doing a bit better and and let them know and help guide them to be able to get there rolling form. Excellent on both for their own personal progress an answer. The progress of the team, so a lot of times it was nice sitting down and saying Hey. Here's what I've seen. Here's what you can work on and this is going to help us win our next race and going to help you get into the Top vote. And so I think a lot of my kind of observing. Ann. And and motivating them on the team really influence them to to be better rowers, and to focus on on their rolling journey. And that was helpful for both them and the team. And I think you know, especially in the constant position. A lot of it is, is motivation and just providing the kind of factory. To get people where they need to go in to give him the motivation in a really difficult sport and so I think. I was able to help a lot of people without and and they in turn were able to to. Pick up their billing and do you know the best of their ability? Were there and really helps the team out? So I think I definitely positively influenced their their actions, which in turn helps the team.	1

Live with these procedures that coming in you have to for me, it's remind people of the positivity that we have. As as working together. Highlighting this you know that it's all 1 as a team, not individual. We have to come together to work with each other. And to make not old age is positive, but also for the customers on board. Just for highlighting little things that people seem to forget their daily basis, how likely very lucky to drop that we do. You know. This many opportunities even any kind of company as I'm accounts. I attend and then we get to travel. The benefits things like that, but we didn't take for granted. These kind of things. I think it's nice to remind people of this. And for me the outcome of this, it makes me feel more positive about the aspect of things are changing. Things are changing, but you know. Suck it reasons and obviously you have to. Ride that wave and get a journey and you may think it's make it at the moment but we'll see. Team praise. I have to feel plus it back everything because you can't you can't be negative. If you're negative effects someone around you so you have to try and have that positivity there. And by trying to invent little things to make people feel better about situations. And make I really big it in half.	1

I think I can give an example. Over this situation. Right. Mostly, when keepers in bad mood. And he tried to shoot them up for at my own works in the casino. Is it stressful?

I think for me. I can remember one such instance, where possibly influencing others actions. Was working at Harris Teeter we? Do often have customers? Who come in on a Monday for their normal pieces? Unfortunately, I didn't get one customer who. Could not have any sort of pizza sauce and Unfortunately? We were not able to offer her another. Option in terms of bread pizzas that we offer. So after speaking with my manager I was able to go ahead and buy her. Some ingredients like and make her a special sauce. But I should be able to enjoy her pizza. As I was taking her sauce. I would continue to hear how she would praise me over the counter. Because not only would she be able to enjoy her pizza with her family. Should also be able to come back time and time again an also tell others about her wonderful experience with us? At her skeeter. For me, it's not just about making a sale is also making sure that your customers are happy as well. Doing whatever it takes to ensure that their lives are just. Intervenes is a little as possible. I feel that when you're striving to do your best to make everyone around you happy. Not only are you doing, the best you can do. For others will see that and they will want to be around you enough to make sure that. Not only that you are kids that they are good as well.	0

In my current work please. I have been able to positively influence the actions of others. By helping our volunteers that come out. I work on an ambulance. So we have volunteers that come out in our learning. And I'm able to help them by. Showing them people skills and showing them how to always be nice to a patient or patient's family. They're going through a really rough time because they're not used to being on an ambulance and it's a really scary time for them. So showing my volunteers that they need to always think about the family and the patient. And that they are not used to this situation. Is a great way? I influenced by volunteers and then they're able to take that out on the road with them. When they go and have their own calls. And they can use that on the road and I think it's just a great way to positively influence them. Because you can never be too nice in those types of situations.	1

I was able to pour off to the side and tell her you know just breathe don't take things personal. We were able to contact the tag person to come on out. In be able to fix the printer and that is was just a great time to pretty much be able to get them. Get to know the customer is a little bit better, and 1st and foremost apologize to them for the inconvenience. The time is 2 and then we will get it resolved as quickly as possible. And that if he needs me. Just remember I'm right here next to her to help her. Whatever she needed at that time, she was able to calm down and remain a little remain more positive. And she was affected and getting their customers moved along, especially after the tech person came and fixed the situation. She was great for the customers were grateful they were able to laugh and joke the rest of the time. They were understanding as well, and we were able to allow everything the lines to flow as smoothly as possible afterwards.	1
Since I have quite a bit of experience with customer service. I tried to give the best customer service, so influencing people is to always smile right off so they know that you're friendly. You're willing to help listen to them. Understand their concerns understand if they're not liking the. If they're not sure what product they want or what service they need to try to give them assistance. I tried it positively give what I think they're looking for or an I do ask questions to verify that.	1

Yes, situation in which I was able to positively influence the action of others. I am currently a teacher. Assistant working with special education and behavior issue. Students at Middle School and I started with a class 3 years ago, they were 6 graders self contained class very challenging. Initially they did not like me, I was an outsider. I moved here from the East Coast. They didn't trust me. It was very difficult every day, I came in and gave it my best, then stay positive and energetic and enthusiastic and obviously patience and perseverance then by the end of the year. I had gained their trust. They had started doing work doing what they were told to do and 3 years later. They just graduated from 8th grade and they high. Five me when they see me in the hallway, I see them out in the. Community at local high school football games, they seek me out is then miss them your favorite teacher so. Again very challenging but very gratifying an again with a lot of work in patients than enerji. I was able to turn many of those students around make them realize that education is so important. And that really. I just wanted the best for best for them and they could be as successful as they could. And. Heading off to high school and then beyond I do have a quick student thing from last year, I get several letters and thank you. Dear miss them. Thank you for having thank you for being so amazing.

So during college, I was a residential advisor an I had a lot of freshmen students that would come in. From high school and a lot of times they would be. Kind of on the fence of whether or not they should join a club or join an extra curricular or what they wanted to do with their majors and I was always. Able to have an open door policy wherever I had people coming up on my door, we could come at anytime. Between the hours of 9 and 5 and I would be there, waiting and listening they ever need any advice. And I just wonder awning Chloe and Chloe came in and she was talking about whether or not, she said switch major major she had been there, but And she felt like. The current path of chemistry was not what she was wanting to do and so I actually brought in a friend of mine who was a chemistry major and he was actually about to graduate. I I actually jump into means it down and she asked for a while, she was able to find out that that's how I actually heard Pat her. So, we, we, we brainstormed we put a whole. List together of what interests are and what didn't and we finally came to the conclusion that once you really was. Fashion about is that she loved. She loved to write and she loved to create stories so introduced her to a writing club on introduced her to some of our. So we're writing our writing professors and she ended up changing her major and she she emailed me the other day that she. She accepted the internship for summer stories and she still send me some other stories today.	1
I would say a time that I had the opportunity to positively influence. Others would be where I worked at enterprise rental car. He would have a customer come in for an example, she was very upset, she needed a mini vans. She was going on a family vacation and he didn't have one provided for her at the moment usually when that happens. We just say kind of sorry about your luck. But she was very upset so I asked her what time they were leaving and how I could last time I guess that they would be leaving? I called everywhere, I drove I found a mini van for them and I specifically brought it to their home and I gave them a free tank of gas. Just to turn it out look around. You don't want their vacation to start off on a bad foot or bad leg. And I wanted to make sure that they remember that I did go that extra mile for them and I'm willing to do that. With every single person I come in contact with.	1
One time in the beginning of my. What time in the beginning of my starting job as a busser at a hotel and the breakfast section? We had a convention for an agent branch. To have breakfast with us and there was about 200 people in like 5 waiters. All of my colleagues were like stressed and they felt like they didn't even want to do this before we even got a chance to start. But I said, Maybe if we just split the work up and put them in different sections and just. Try your best to make ourselves look comfortable and greet them an. Make sure they get their water there juice or whatever, they need everything will go smoothly and we will do a good job and have their customers. Pleased with our service.	1
As Acting General Management in my previous days. We did roll out a new drink menu from breast cancer every October. So some of the patrons of some of the customers and some of the coworkers didn't like the new drinks. If that was my duty to change their mentality on getting new things and other things, trying different things and also presenting. A positive outlook so our customers can like the Brandon like the new drinks, so every day, we went through. Each drink gone through the ingredients, ensuring that the 10 quality was presentable to each gas in each coworker. Making a coworker feel very happy about the product. They were giving and also issued what they give out. They present to our customers will be respectable and also good stewardship to our brand and so I think that's the nature of on going above and beyond. Making sure that our coworkers knew what we were giving out and believe the product and so that's the place that where it came from.	1
One situation that I remember where I was able to positively influence the actions of others in a previous. Airline position I was on the ground on the ramp and what I would normally do on every flight. That we upload and download is that during the boarding process. I would go up and get gay chat. Um. With the gate checks. I would go if I had the time, too, if there wasn't any ready yet. I would sit up there and wait once we've already done the upload. I would sit there and wait to see if we had any gauge shotgun, a full flight. So, in particular, Orlando flights of course, there's a lot of kids so once once once I had a flight that I actually. I had a bunch of flight, with loaded with with folks in bags are full I would go up. And actually sit there and wait for the gate checks and as they would go as the kids will go buy it. I should give them high fives and give him more little pounds. Uh as I would say just again just just just to give him that and have that with them. For a while, I was doing that for awhile just off the strings were just doing it. Once I was up there. I started to notice that other folks were doing the same as well, where I would actually take I was actually taking place. Shortly after that, and some of the crew that I would work with I see them. I say Hey. They're actually giving pounds in high fives to kids well again just to have that just to have that. The connection that the kids can have the connections to slide to have a safe flight. Some of these things may be scared. Or just wanna get home or they may be flying alone, but again, it's just to have that connection just to just to kind of give that service all the way around, but that was something that. So I found that was catching on and it became a thing where we were we would give kids in a little town. They have them to let them know that you have a safe flight.	1
Situations were able to positively. Connect with others I have a patient who was. Quite upset with the. When medication windows out for applications and. I was able to actually spend some time with her and tired over report with her sitting in this chat and getting to know her. And the ways in which different pieces at home, so I spent some time with her learning these ways. And I spent some time with my Med team just let him know what she was used to in the aspects of her medications. And we discussed this with marketing decided it was easier. It was better for her if we. Adjusted the medication, so it was more of a positive interaction with her is more positive. Experience for her defeat with us instead of. Feeling that she was being. Forced to do something in a way that she wasn't used to so we made sure that she was able to. Feel comfortable being with us.	1
I currently work for now, I'm and I absolutely love it. We had several opportunities during the course of the day to get on the Plains and clean them. But we weren't doing a great job.

I will check you can character start walking book on board that the aircraft is clear, nobody's pointing fingers at each other. It is great that the kids really came together.	1
At night when I was able to positively influence the actions of others was. When were I was working. Can you call center lady had called in and was a little sad that her part have been lost? In the Mail so I was able to work with her and I did a call tag and it claim. With UPS we were able to locate her package and get it to her. We actually expedite it so that you get it. Here before her ride that she needed it, and we were able to alter not happy with an S experience.	1
When I was working at that PC and my patience wasn't willing to do his exercises or her exercises. By informing the situation the specific situation of this injure her injure and the three men that I was going to apply to the person.

Well, one thing that I like to do as far as making positive attitude is one coming with a positive attitude so. In certain ways and things I'd like to do is Duba. I'm a Zumba instructor and I think that. Brings great positive attitude always coming in at beat. I'm always being energetic and happy to be there because they are your customers and customer service is number one. So as far as influencing others. I influence them to as a positive attitude to enjoy. The moment. It is only an hour class so we get to laugh and have fun and it make it entertaining so as far as. Making a positive influence it would be during one of my Zumba class is talking with the students and. Making it fun for them because they are my customer.	1
But every day in my business. I have been in the mortgage real estate industry for 28 years customer service. For over 30 years. However, I'm the way that I have been able to positively influence others because our job is. So extremely difficult at times very challenging and I'm normally there cheerleader. I was just speaking to one of my coworkers. The other day and she. Ready to quit ready to give up and I told her I said, we make a difference in people's lives. Every single day that we help them get one step closer to home ownership and so one of the things that I told her I said, Hey. Let's get together. Let's sit down. Let's map out a plan. Let's just see how we can get that client there because they are our number one. Sponse ability and trying to help them obtain homeownership, so she took it in stride, she was excited about it and. And next thing you know, we're sitting down or writing an action plan. So now somebody else is not going to be overlooked and they're going through. I think the dream that they've always wanted and that should be coming home owner.	1
The situation in which I positively influence the action of others was at my current job, had so planetarium. When I was hoping plans Black History Month. I work in a building where diversity isn't always present for prevalent an I had to plan out an entire month. Black History Month, long event. And it was me taking charge and taking read which had my fellow coworkers who really trusting me and this truck. Actually led to them going out and finding amazing sponsors and partners. And just how amazing group of people to come in for Black History Month, which in the long wrong actually lead to. My coworkers being able to plan other month all by themselves months like Friedman Latino heritage month without my help or guidance. More leadership roles, they ended up doing all of that by themselves, then definitely something that's really important to me, so the fact that they could go out. On their own know what they need to do to include everybody wishes truly amazing and. I think all the moments when it's about went really well.	1
Anytime I employed someone is in a positive manner that I'm sending positive tone and that I. Really, thinking positive messages across. For a situation in which? I positively influence people's actions. Was? My freshman year of college had a small Catholic University. Going with small Catholic University, there's not much diversity. Bye I took that infest types. It seems to me to be able to teach people who may not have experience. Black gay man before. So is able to. Chico spot, which become actions that people may have. And. Allow them to know that asking questions OK. Learning is OK. That when you want to learn about somebody says the best positive thing you can do because it breaks down. Boundaries. And opens up doors of conversation allow people to circulate comfortable with one another. So the situation being. Survivors. The action rifle was opening up disappearance in creating a gay club on encountered Reversi approved. For the first time. And I've been allowed students coming out. Health tap Catholicism in religion intertwined with. Homosexuality. And really start getting the conversation diversity moving on Camera.	1
I well in my previous job we would do morning huddles. And just growing up, having a positive attitude, I believe. That influences the room just being you know. Starting with a positive attitude and just. Um. Cheering everybody on you know, but I feel like. Basically lights up the room and it gets boring for the day of work.	1
Hi I was able to successfully influenced others when we had when I was working. As a Event planner, we had to organize a big event for some of our Top clients and. Some of our. People wanted to do it one way uhm. Which was not going to be cost effective or efficient and I was able to run a report have the numbers and showed them exactly why we needed to do it another way. And was able to have them understand the reasoning behind it, and we ended up having a very successful event. I'm happy for loyal customers.	1
Hi the situation where I was possibly positively influence the action of others is man there was one time. We were out and about in my friends, we are going to the grocery store. And then They did they wanted to leave all the shopping carts outside. So what I did was I took my through the designated area in the parking lot, where it belongs. And then they ended up doing the same thing.	1
OK so I think a time where I possibly impassive positively influenced people around me is I do that, mostly everyday at my job. I have a group meeting before the start of our dinner or lunch time period, an I kind of go over. Main steps that I wanna take for achieving that a good dinner service, so I will focus in on one thing. An as the end of my dinner eyes or lunch. I kind of reward right highlight what would well. So I will discuss how certain. French customers were like fell over appreciated and I think that's sort of very important part of like getting some of our team and everything.	1
And one of my most previous roles. I worked at Macy's. The retail store, Ann and during our holiday season. That's At the time that of course, picks up in our busiest season, so myself as a team lead. I worked in the Housewares Department. And So what we did was in order to keep you know spirits high and NRG high 'cause it can. Kind of got draining after a while if you know doing the same thing everyday then being so busy. Back to back with customers and So what I did I would designate one day per week. If we had the time. If not, then biweekly. Couldn't get together for about 20 to 30 minutes and coordinate our break so that of course, our floor would be covered. Engers enable us to say have a good time have some drinks have some some food and just fellowship with each other during our break time. I'm doing that helps us to stay energized and motivated to you know attack that busyness with the same spirit. So definitely just keeping each other engaged an allowing my team to just refresh and relax for a second. It enables us to have more energy throughout the day, too. Help our customers in any way that we can to ensure that they'll come back and shop with us again in the future.	1
More often than not a lot of our coworkers come to work and they forget to leave their home life at home and come to work with a positive new attitude. One time I did help my coworker who was being a little Grouchy. You know a little snappy to passengers by. Making them jolted laugh at them and ask him what's going on just remind them Hey. We are in a work environment and no matter what you're going through we do have to do our job and make our passengers. Still, at home, so that's the situation, I did have to handle.	1
I would say a good instance of. Influencing influencing others in a positive way would be an A. Previous position when I worked at Walmart warehouse. It was, I was in a team lead position, the team that I had gotten was not meeting a right. And the the goal was that when they were supposed to. Be able to process 300 units within an hour, they were only doing a little over 200. I change the start meeting to enable others to get a positive experience at the beginning of this year. We would involve everyone I I was a positive influence you know to start with the meeting in the 1st place. Because of course, it starts with management so you have to be that the person that smiling and making sure everyone is doing things appropriately in the beginning. So we play games provided candy and I started giving out gift cards. Just to try and motivate an have inclusion within our our team, so within about 3 months. They went from a 200 rate to about 270? Which of course, that wasn't meeting the goal? But it was a significant increase so I would say that was a really good thing we had a lot of. Public feedback from our own teammates, encouraging others to help me write and clean the areas needed so I would say. That was a good experience as far as trying to get the team involved in helping make everything better for the company.	1
Well, I was recently a coaching high school football and it was sort of a program where I kind of went back. It will community where I grew up at noon and the kids were less fortunate. And I was put in a position to wear. That I have to like really like healthy kids trying to figure out who they were, and what they want to do in life. And not go down the road that they've seen so many other slowdown that live until I get to temple. Rosa crime in different other adventures that could and probably have another future on it. Well, I was capable of having his own man achieve a goal that I was much cleaning to them as I can get an achievable where? They won enough games to make it to the playoffs and there's nothing at the school had never done before. We didn't know that we ended up actually making it also Good Morning America. It was an amazing experience and good morning. Here at that actually as well cable a trip to Disney World. I think it was just a surreal experience in. I'm just thankful to be able to do that with the kids but in that position.	1

Where I was on the PTR speed committees or practice committee for nurses that that was my profession and? We reviewed practice standards for nurses and help them improve their practice. We used peer reviewed literature in order to do that and we did case studies. Where in we reviewed specific cases in the hospital that I was working at where a nurse had submitted? How many asking whether or not uh standards of care were followed and what could it be? What could have been done better and if there was a safety event. Or, a protocol reached and we used several resources in order to do that research we use research we used. Prior case studies presidents in nursing practice and then we would disseminate that information back to the person who started the ticket and they report it to their manager and it would be disseminated back to all the. Uh people under them and their practice with well, they would be encouraged to improve their practice as a result of our recommendations so that would be. An example of positively impacting the activity of others.	1

You know experiencing life. I realize that it's best to kill people with kindness and. I realize that that's the best action when it comes to life in general is to to use the kindness and sweetness of yourself, too. So humble yourself into to better yourself and to me personally, I I've. I've had situations where people have been unruly and and disgruntled. And I realized that when it comes to dealing with anybody who's disgruntled or unruly that's the best situation. In that aspect is to basically you know kill people with kindness and I feel like that's the only time that I've ever seen you know. It actually work is is. When you kill people with kindness.

I was previously employed at T-Mobile. And one of the Main. Goals for T-Mobile is to recruit or have new customers. One thing that I did that I notice that. We didn't have as a company when joining was. A uniform set of. How to rate plans where and how? Gnu gnu employees would be able. To assess Will plan and rate plan that everyone was able to be eligible for so one thing that I did. Was instead of just working at my store as an associate? I went to my district and actually my region and show them a quick format and did a spreadsheet for them, so that we could all. Had better results, which resulted in better customer service. Better results for. The customers of course, 'cause they could see everything and understand what was going on. And just the environment that we worked because we didn't have other employees hesitating to work with other customers. So I feel like I bring. Great deal. Our organization. And just to be able to be organized usually influences others to have a more positive outlook.	1
And. A situation where I was able to positively influence. Others is throughout high school I was a captain of my rowing team. Being the captain I was able to motivate my teammates make sure they're practicing you know positive attitudes towards one another. Make sure there's are participating in activities safely on just having overall great experience. It's important to have a positive attitude. One thing I always say in negativity breeds, negativity since you bring out awesome attitude. It has an attitude.	1
In most of the jobs that I've worked. B. Actions of others. We're dependent on their emotions at the time and. There were multiple times where I would step in and an talk to them and be able to deescalate the situation. And make sure that my coworkers knew how to respond in a proper respectful way for a business on Top of this. With customers of working in multiple customer service positions. I was able to offer a great deal of. I respect and Be able to positively influence the action of actions of others you know just from small little things too. Not being able to run a whole team of people.	1
Uh. Describe the time where I had a positive effect on others. I have a best friend. To his personality, the way he is. He's always lazy you know, he's always. He always procrastinate a lot and he takes his time he put off things that he's supposed to do. So I would always give him advice. Based on personal experience and tell him that you have to get things done 1st. And then you could chill after. So once you know get everything done immediately. On time it. Have a better impact on Musicali stress less when you have to rush to do it and efficient. Efficiency doing that task. Greatly reduces because you're rushing you are under stress so. I always used to mentor him in how to get things done in a timely manner, and then you could do whatever you want after that. And now he took my advice and he's better at Time Management and. He doesn't really put things off until the last minute, he does things. As soon as they come here is the job done so. I feel like I had a positive impact on him and how he does. Things now.	1
So that when I used to work with the Intercoastal Group. We used to do marketing for AT&T. So we would have to go door to door at times, you know being that our corporate trainer I used to. Choose to go door to door times, so a lot. There was very limited limited amount of women they used to be. At our company and the woman over there used to be very afraid of getting to go out there. Can meet people door to door and really just put themselves out there? I'm so me being that I've always been outspoken and I've never been afraid to step up and trying things. I decided to start going by myself, You know before the rest of the girls fit and I began to give them that model. And show them that look we can do this like yeah, we're girls and yeah, I know you're afraid of. What the possibilities of what can happen, but you know what can happen if we? How do we know what's gonna happen if we don't? Get out there and at least try so I was able to show these girls that by going out there and putting myself out there and getting it done. They can do it, too, and soon enough deferral started getting out there and doing their jobs, too. And they started getting great at it and they started to like it. Next thing you know they started getting people fighting up with us and a lot of people started getting the fiber optics with AT&T. And if you know if I didn't get bowling put myself out there and try to create myself as this role model for these other women. Who knows if they would have followed in my footsteps and I've been as successful as they are today? You know, I don't like to brag and say that you know it's because of me, but you know. These girls were afraid at some point and I am glad that I was a part of getting to help them out and get them out of their shells.	1
I situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others was a time we had a very. I hope you can and get the actions. I took to resolve it an to make again comfortable and feel like they were heard. I was able to. Getting what they wanted in a timely manner, and without getting flustered without getting upset out and in the end. It's already turned out by giving you very happy, yeah, and he left satisfied. And making a workers are just very impressed with the way that I handle this situation, not getting flustered.	1
At my past jobs. I was able to positively influence the actions of others because of some great books. That I read towards. Our responsibilities presenting and being more welcoming for people and. So that helped me a lot for the job itself presenting because there are many times that I was hosting and I have to present. And and have a comfortable. Confidence and And it helps my colleagues and actually help their work also so. It was pretty fun seeing everyone improve and it felt nice to know that people were interested in trying something that I did. So it's not good to be able to influence and be part of a team where we could support each other and. Give each other some advice on on. Doing great work.	1
To make sure. I previously. And my current my previous role. I had to probably influence others by taking on a leadership role so basically I was training. The employees on how and how to do the daily duties of the job and by that I had to. Be very positive very, very influential. So that the new hires would understand how to do their job and also do it in officially manner. So, in that instance. I have to be a really great leader very passionate about what I'm doing and passionate about teaching others how to? Do their job properly so that'll. Post a positive effect on the company as well.	1
A situation in which I was able to positively influence action of someone was actually when I was at the mall shopping. A person shares actually there is a group of younger kids next to me. Kind of being a little fishy and I was paying attention to them. Notice that they were kind of sneaking things into their little bag that they had from another store had a stroke up some conversation and. Hum. Kind of just like let them know that I saw what they did. And that it wasn't a good thing to do, and try to convince them to be good people. Hum. End up putting stuff away for which is simple. Talking to them simply talking to him, it worked, and. I know that in that situation, it's probably kind of taught them a lesson about every thinking about doing that ever again? So.	1
So Luckily I have been able to benefit of water, the opportunity to perform any theme parks in Orlando. Coming from a background of social work as well as I'm dancing theater working in the theme park has been able to. Kind of take on leadership roles among amongst my peers or even given this spacing oppurtunity to kind of. Talk to them and tell them like why, why we should work with integrity for example, there's been plenty of times where? Be coming in the morning and you know, everyone is allowed to have a good or a bad day, an I think they look. Those are those moments when you asked was having a bad day. Every child him and say, Hey, you know where I know you're having a rough day. You know, but I really want you to go. Find the Magic in your day and I really want you to go. Find the magic and helping someone else. Maybe by helping someone else just forget about yourself. There's plenty of times where I come into work and I'm right here is kind of like cut corners. And for me personally, speaking with the rules of the rules so if we go out on set an were out there. Reading it from hanging out with the character. And we're going on there and my escort in my Wrangler wants to cut myself short. I say Hey, you know what I don't mind getting extra family or 2. You just never know with the family. They were going through and is it plenty of times. We're going out like I said in my escorts I wanted to like. Shave off a minute or 2 and I'm like Oh, I would personally by the work with integrity, so let's go ahead and let's say out and then. Plenty of times if there are extra or longer, and we've met a family who had made both of our days. So.	1

So with over 5 years of experience I think the most important that. Had within a job would be at Sapara, where I. Was approached by people for a different type of issues? They were having so whether it was in skin care? Need it or perhaps aTo try or had anything problematic skin. I would definitely. You the person that they were coming, too, so I guess I'm positively able to. Influence the actions of others by being that tool so there was a question or if there was some sort of uncertainty or maybe some nervousness about a product or whatever it may have been. It was on you to help guide you and help understand why you do have these questions may reassure you that. It will actually be OK, other than positively influence you too. Do better within yourself, so if I'm telling you that this product is going to be based on what you're telling me. The the kind of needs and requirements that your skin care means then. I think that. That would have definitely been something that would influence the actions of others always was just by. Providing them with the tools and information they needed to. Get the results that they wanted and it almost positive way I would never wish. Hell on anyone that would come in or do anything to jeopardize their faith or whenever they're concerned with.	1

You just have to be able to multi task and help those who are in need, and then it just. It makes the team effort grow and then it just shows up positive leadership that others will follow after you.	1
UH-1 situation that I was able to probably influence the actions of others. Was I would have to say in sports? I was? Selected with you, girl to go an do a volleyball tournament in Florida, an we were getting a little discouraged because we weren't. The best and weren't doing. All that great, but I no matter the negativity that surrounded the situation, I was. Uplifting everyone I was dancing, we were doing little freestyles.

During my time at banner health. We had a lot of changes happening very rapidly and a lot of employees were. Not upset little bit disgruntled what I did to help alleviate the situation is I use comedy and lasting relief to help. Play fever feel better and more comfort. Rible nothing needs to people feel better than laughing and in doing that. I hope that you're not as upset and I also explained to them like it's OK to not be happy.

So what I did so the situation was that I'm a food and beverage supervisor for the hotel. I work at. I'm in charge of like the whole food and Beverage Department. So I manage the team and there was a situation where? To come. Team members were not agreeing they were kind of having little disagreements and always bickering and they really took a toll on the whole Department. So one time when when there was practice going on. They both kind of started going, adding an I didn't want that to keep going so. Once practice ended I stopped everything I called Hey. My my goal was really to resolve that situation so I put. Pull them aside, both of them to the onto the meeting space. At least at the hotel has and I just talked to them and I just wanted both to kinda. Be able to express themselves in the state environment where it was only them to it wasn't with everybody else. Where other people's ideas and influences could affect them, so I wanted them to feel safe and comfortable being able to talk to each other. And they were both expressing about how they just didn't agree with somebody doing this and they are they all had a different. Perspective in it, so my goal really was to really change that and to really help them kind of work together and kind of. Point that each other has so at the end of the day, we did kind of squashed everything that they both had I was a mediator. Who was trying to just help them and be able to end of the Department and it really has changed the Department a lot since then. So I'm very, very proud about that. But I'm now based they have so much more room to still grow I think. But now they work so much better with each other and more as a team.	1
Good morning, so I'm sitting here trying to think of a time when I was able to positively influence. The actions of others and the first thing that comes to mind that I work at a hotel. For Amazon dot supervisor. We have all kinds of things going on in the hotel typically the weekends really busy and. It's nice of course, you made all of these different people coming from different places, but a lot of people. May come in very angry this would be things like that. The one instance, where I'm thinking about something that happened. Not too long ago, I had I guess who was walked from a different property because the property was oversold. And this graph was pretty upset seeing as though they had been walked to the new properties, with it being so late in the evening. And he didn't understand how the process works so. I knew that although he came in very upset and very agitated with me, I know that I couldn't take it personal. Yes, he was really just upset with situation so after speaking with him about how things like that happen and how we would make sure that his say. Will go nice and smooth? Take me about 5 minutes of convincing him, but everything will be fine. But before the conversation was over the guess was. Actually give me a hug and thanking me for being so patient and understanding and also apologizing. The way that he initially handled him.	1

Good morning for stuff I would like to apologize for my voice. I am dealing with a small head cold. But I am really excited for this interview and the question is how would you describe a situation that you were able to possibly influence others? But the actions of others. I was able to positively influence the actions of others by working as a certified nursing assistant is one of. The health care facility that I work in We were in the dining room and you were helping our residents. Ether food and help them. Prepare everything that they needed and get information that they needed. There was 1 scene. A That was having a difficult time, with being able to get another resident, to comply to eat. They didn't really want to get work done so. I got it from what I was doing and I went over and I sat next to. It's very kind of things with the things he was pressured like I can take over minutes if you need to. I sat down and I was able to. I'm back to the resident asked about her family and what do you eat and redirect her attention to you? Wanting to eat and being able to eat 100% per meal, which is what she really needed. Because she wasn't telling him she needed that nutrition in her life to help her keep going forward and. After 1580 nineteen, she was so grateful that. I was able to help and that we could have our residents. You know, I'm through that he needed to, and not having a scene and keep the president calling collected. And now I have your drill agitated or the like done anything, it was pushing her, too hard. And. That is how I was able to populate influence somewhere.	1
So when we have able to positively influence. Others was when I was working in retailers at Kendra Scott I was. Eh. I don't need an I was a key Holder and kind of. Doing both in our doors in like a more about leadership in a kind of higher hello higher than a lot of 'em. I was able to kind of. He blew me we're having a change of Management. On. Another different positive outlook and you're a big thing everyone always in plays RV trailers attitude. So I kind of agree with any negative 2 Monday and I try to make it more positive and. Need little competitions and one thing also that would change makes everyone feel better when there's food involved. So I kind of got intrigued and it just brought everyone up and it made everyone feel better and. Omar com And a lot of times with our events that would help to an event days were happening. People were little bit more president, they were more catastrophe. And it's just kind of always having a positive attitude really. Can help you know everyone else?	1
I remember a time when I first moved out to Las Vegas, 2, 1/2 years 2 years ago. In my first job was Staybridge Suites. 20 Marten and it was, I worked in the complementary. Breakfast area. I hope with the complimentary breakfast and it was around Christmas time. And I remember the hotel is designed for. 1559 four. Is Dennis gay or people just want conditions so this one particular time it was around Christmas and? It was families here on vacation and it was awful. It also family there that may have had my situations that happen in their life like? Yarsan it were forced to come to hotel different things of that nature So what I saw was. The kid on vacation has downloads and stuff, and the other kids. They didn't have anything because of course, they lost everything in the fires or whatever the situations. We have been so when I decided to do that next year. I decided to purchase some toys and I made sure that every kid I can't do that. Door. Was able to receive one? My job got it was such a wonderful idea that they also continued it up, they they do it every year now. Because you know you just don't know what people are going through an I just really felt for the children. Do they have anything so that's kind of what I did, and I felt really good about it and like I said my job. The continuing to this day.	1
Yes, I had a situation once where I had 2 children with down the road, he was sick. Before passing by an I had the opportunity to help him and I called from and stayed with him until the Amazon fire trucks got there. And they ended up taking him to the hospital and he's doing much better now.	1
At my job where I currently work at before I organized a area to wear. And we had a lot of tornadoes an? A lot of Hurricanes, hitting at one time and my company. As a restoration company and we were very overwhelmed so. I decided that we all work as a team and. Map out certain things and take sections out of a bill to where one person would do one thing. Another person would do another thing another person or do another thing, so that we can compile altogether. At once so not just one person was being overwhelmed an you know not. Being stressful or anything like that, she had back up and she had at least 4 or 5 people with her. In order to get the bill complete so I believe that that's something that I influence to help make the situation a whole lot. For us and for my supervisor as well.	1
I currently work for Amtrak and one of the situations occur on every trip is the fact that putting sounds together. We have large groups, especially in the summer time travel and sometimes it's very difficult. One of the things I had in it. 15. Our recent train that I had totally better, so I had to basically ask people to give up their very good seats. To make this family. Everybody was very, very positive because they had little children and it was just a good outcome. I notice if you just go up to people and ask them to do something like this, you need their help. They're more than. Happy to help you with the situation you're in.	1
And one of my previous jobs, I worked as a consonant agent. I'm free USA bank so we talked on the Phone with customers. Most of the time customers are calling. Upset. You know whether attitude regarding their bank account. I once had a poll worker that got really upset about a Phone call because of the tone that the. Customer has with her, she was ready to. You know basically snap in. And it wasn't going to be pretty. I talked her down. I explain to her no matter what the customer says to you, you cannot. Retaliate against them in a negative manner, so I talked to her or calm her down, she went back to her Phone call with a positive attitude. And everything in this movie on that Phone call with that customer.	1
I was fortunate enough to be able to be on crew that flight crew that had a group of passengers that had been delayed several times do too. Mechanical issues uh anyway, they uh without them on our flight. It was long flight about 4 hours. 'cause they were very happy to. Getting going finally and so are our situation was a group of disgruntled passengers. The task was obviously to get them to their destination safely. Um and uh we were able to. Kind of changed the whole did you know the whole demeanor that they ended up being we ended up playing games and celebrated a birthday? 4 hour flight we did several services throughout the cabin and in the end, we ended up getting a several. Letters of recommendation load setup several letters of combinations and we ended up getting a crew of the month, her base. And so that was exciting that was a problem. It definitely felt like we had published our task of. Getting there safely, but also kind of changing their their outlook and uplifting them a little bit. They were definitely relieved and. Their flight went well and it was, it was fun. It was a lot of fun and like I said. Given. Getting that actually the month was definitely the end result and and it was, it was very rewarding problem it.	1
In the customer service that I am experienced in is serving and there are many situations where I have to positively influence. Others because it does get stressful and so I take the leadership role of influencing others by positive affirmation. And letting them know that everything is gonna be OK an. Letting them know that their friends are great to the company and not if we all work together as a team. We can get this through and done.	1
So you can solution but I was able to positively influence the actions of others. Was when I worked previously for the Walt Disney travel companies? Are was part of their call center King? So I spoke directly through to travel agents to be able. To work with someone smoking their vacation plans for their deaths per people out there trying to put on vacation. And usually when it came to very limited availability with saying it was either the rooms or the number of. Guess that can't that. Governor comedy at the time is something wasn't available. I can I would definitely give them other options and usually? With. Giving some other options and explaining the benefits of that resort and how it's very similar to the vision that they first wanted. They would usually go with the one that I provided to them. I would usually give them at least 2. 3 options just to keep it limited. And just to keep your options open for them and their gas. And usually Almost 99% of the time they were always going to one of the three that I was able to provide. The vacation as magical responsible for their gas.	1
The situation, I was able to find the instance reaction and others. Through the scene. Um. Helping coworkers at work. To uh? Deliver the festival. Performance against Ann. Say. I work in a hotel so I can help you with some little bit. I work in a hotel so I guess with. Interaction with guests. If I had to do training of knew of. I will be training this new coworkers. Oh, I would give them advice is how to? Still, with some situations, they haven't done before. Or and I got. Positive. The actions that I'm not very good thing I guess.	1
And. So I think a way to positively influence the actions of others is through communication number one listening to what? There needs maybe an acting on that, especially in customer service. And. Trying to effectively listen to what exactly it is that they need and being able to not only meet their expectations. Trying to go above and Beyond and I think an example is when I've done that would be. Hum. When I flew last. Ann. I would say. Having a minor child on there that isn't flying with their with their parents and being able to. Keep them safe. Or being able to calm someone down. When they're really anxious. Ann. I would say positively effects. Their actions for being able to calm someone down that's angry and trying to tell you what, exactly it is that they weren't being able to listen and to be able to. Communicate effectively. Ann. What exactly the solution is?	1
I thought that I was able to positively influence the actions of others was. Couple years ago we had just started are gluten free. Program, where I presently work and we were doing event for 2000 people and needed a bunch of gluten free items and so I was able to. Jump back in the kitchen, which I don't normally do but. Get out there and possibly influenced everybody like this how you do everything and this is how we can prevent cross contamination to keep. Those were gluten allergy safe. And in the end, we didn't have any. Where tissues so I would say it was a successful endeavors?	1
A time where I was actually able to influence others. I worked an English Department chair as English Department chair I was able to work. With all English teachers, not only at my location, but also at 4 other schools. When I was able to do, we had to, I was responsible to? Manage a lot of the events for our teachers as well as our students. So one thing I was able to do is during the meetings I would also. Listen to everyone's input and then from there, I would do an amalgamation of what everybody says, and then create an event from there. The result of the action was really great because I had a lot more inquiry. and I had a lot more investment into the program because I actually listen to what everyone had to say. Which was really helpful for me because when you're in English Department he ran with your English teacher you want to make sure that you're speaking and listening to. I mean, the visuals that actually are incorporated or involved in the Department and then also you're able to take it inquiry of. And the students and what their interests are as well. So unable to influence everyone by being able to create a program that everybody was interested in. It was not that great because the tours of the students went out the investment of the teachers went up. And overall I enjoyed it very much.	1
I would have to say that a situation where I was able to positively. Influence the action of others. Would have to be? When? I was in high school. We had a Beta Club meeting. We have to come up with some kind of community service. From that, we were gonna do or philanthropy that we're gonna help. With that year, I have a huge, huge heart for special needs children an children who are less fortunate. So we all volunteered at Camp Smile, an I honestly think that it changed. Being whole atmosphere of our beta code for the whole year as a team. And it made them look at life in a more positive way as to. What they are more thankful for that they don't have to struggle daily? Having to just simply brush her teeth or put on clothes.	1
Hi there, At my current position as a customer service agent for jet star Airways. We had a delayed flight. Which is more than over 10 hours and we had a part of all our dress passengers into a hotel? And at this time, we were going through the line and me, and my coworker were working together as a team. And. It was a family to couples 2 older couples. I would say in their mid 70s anyways. We assign them to a room. But I I knew when I saw them that they were going to need 2 rooms my coworkers said. Out loud, no they don't need to room. An I said, I go. Coworker. I think they do need to room. Sir older couple an and then she was like no they don't. So I pushed her aside quietly and I said told the customer services. Please give us a moment and I had to explain to her because she is young, she's in her early 20s. And I wanted to explain to her when you get older. You know that more privacy as when you are when you're in your 20s early 20s early 30s. It's OK, possibly to share a room with another. Couple the favor like I said older and I wanted to explain to her like things changed when he did. Older and you have to be a little bit more respectful and understanding kind of like. Projector not predicted think forward is what they would do you think they would need at this age? And so I explain return and she went back to the gas customers and she said. Sorry and it was going to be no problem to get them to separate rooms. And in the end, the The couples are very happy and very gracious and thankful that they were able to get 2 separate rooms. Thanks.	1

Hi my name is Tamera more and one experience I've had where I had influenced positively over someone else. Someone was traveling for the first time on an airplane and I was able to help them through their journey. They were able to get on the plane, they were very nervous, but they were able to save in the plane. And at take off. I was able to hold their hand and help them through their journey along their way to their destination. And so they were able to fly for the first time and it wasn't so bad.	1

The outcome was recommendations for a further upgrade or pay upgrades by our general manager.	1
And so the question is to describe a situation in which I was able to positively influence others. I actually get to do that. About 4 times a weekly basis. I'm actually a behavioral use counselor so it is my job to positively influence. Kids that I work with kids I work with a range from. Home to 13 years old just today. Today I generally help my kids with things like temperament and decision making. But just doing things right from wrong, a lot of these kids come from backgrounds where they haven't had. A positive adult figure in their lives on just an example of a situation at it, I'll get frustrated last week. Because he was struggling to do something else because cleaning his room and 1st. She's really upset because I don't understand that. He's never been taught this and gave that he was certain age, I expected him to do you know how to do something? Is it talking things through and getting to understand one another better? I was able to help him and teach him? How to go about things correctly and it ended up being a positive experience for everybody and in turn I also built more of her. I work with my clients so. That's definitely one of the few times that I've been able to positively impact my kids at work.	1
A time when I was able to positively. For others was when I was working at Samaritans purse. Hours of volunteer relations representative and I worked alongside two other ladies.

And I just think that I've seen work and how we all influence each other. Not being positive by 11 what we do here was. Select what made it all work well.	1

Well, one thing that I like to do as far as making positive attitude is one coming with a positive attitude so. In certain ways and things I'd like to do is Duba. I'm a Zumba instructor and I think that. Brings great positive attitude always coming in at beat. I'm always being energetic and happy to be there because they are your customers and customer service is number one. So as far as influencing others. I influence them to as a positive attitude to enjoy. The moment. It is only an hour class so we get to laugh and have fun and it make it entertaining so as far as. Making a positive influence it would be during one of my Zumba class is talking with the students and. Making it fun for them because they are my customer.	1
More often than not a lot of our coworkers come to work and they forget to leave their home life at home and come to work with a positive new attitude. One time I did help my coworker who was being a little Grouchy. You know a little snappy to passengers by. Making them jolted laugh at them and ask him what's going on just remind them Hey. We are in a work environment and no matter what you're going through we do have to do our job and make our passengers. Still, at home, so that's the situation, I did have to handle.	1
A situation in which where I was able to possibly possibly influence the action of my others was a recently at work. When a system blackout happened, I was able to encourage. My fellow coworkers to keep moving to provide all the services that were still available, so even though systems was down. I do not want to focus on the negative and focus more on positive. What I did was went around at others? How can I fit because I am very familiar with a lot of? Other roles that we have in the store because I've already had them so with that was able to. Basically let him know exactly how I can sit in different areas, and then also I was able to get. First, he probably hated this happened before. Let's not focus on the negative. Let's keep it moving this is what we can provide too. Everything with a smile and not don't break a sweat an that made everybody tomorrow and just keep it moving. To the fact that the blackout ended before we knew it and see operations is up to running it was more. Of a positive outcome because somebody else is being positive in encouraging others to be positive throughout the whole. It's raining.	1
So I was a trainer when I was a beauty consultant at Target. And in those training sessions. I'm point to the positive action page that I've trained from workers. I put forth the image of positive iti teamwork and maintaining a professional image and always putting the customer. 1st. And in chipper and just smiling 'cause. It was a great place to work and I was training them but. It wasn't just working hard it was. Being positive while working hard. And in that I have 2 girls that I trained that are still there. One of which is on the management track. And I would say that part of that would be from the fact that we constantly work together. And I trained her further after I got into development about how to gain more experience and move up. While working at Target. One of my proudest moments was in my review my manager says that my strongest. That was my Papa Trinity. And then I was a strong team member a team worker and that my enthusiasm and empathy carry over to the guests. And my team members and it was evident. I think that maintaining that empathy brings positive aspects out of everyone and I would love to bring that. Through any interactions that I have with guest of the airline I think that. Work can be instilled but that attitude has to be there, so I love. Putting forth an example, an using carpet ready to guide. And I think that. Doctors leads to positive outcomes, no matter what.	1
I well in my previous job we would do morning huddles. And just growing up, having a positive attitude, I believe. That influences the room just being you know. Starting with a positive attitude and just. Um. Cheering everybody on you know, but I feel like. Basically lights up the room and it gets boring for the day of work.	1
I have been able to positively influence the actions of others by being part of the leadership team where I currently work. I've been able to mentor many of the different team members and have them grow in their leadership abilities. And and To help them keep the right attitude. In this situation and to learn about how best? Thing can be positive. Within their environments, not just a positive influence, but to be positive as well.	1
At my past jobs. I was able to positively influence the actions of others because of some great books. That I read towards. Our responsibilities presenting and being more welcoming for people and. So that helped me a lot for the job itself presenting because there are many times that I was hosting and I have to present. And and have a comfortable. Confidence and And it helps my colleagues and actually help their work also so. It was pretty fun seeing everyone improve and it felt nice to know that people were interested in trying something that I did. So it's not good to be able to influence and be part of a team where we could support each other and. Give each other some advice on on. Doing great work.	1
Hi describe a situation, which we were able to positively influence the action. Actions of others. Well, what comes to mind for me is, I've been teaching yoga for the past couple of years. And every time I step on the mat and teach my class, I feel like I make a huge impact. On them and positively affect them, for that hour, hopefully carry them through the week. So that's for one example, I can think of where I have a positive influence on others. An I also worked as a nurse. Currently, an my patience mean the world to me, so when they're under my care. I do the best I can to be a good advocate for them. Teachers with respect and give them the best care while I'm there.	1
I guess. At the time I was working in sales with Phone fails to be specific, um a customer did not want to purchase. The item and I did not force the customer to go ahead and get that item. I went ahead and I explained. To him the details of why he needed the item in why it would help him and his cellphone experience. All throughout the entire process you really want to go in. Get down into the gradient can never wanna cut people off either. That's very disrespectful way to talk to people. You always want to go ahead and listen to the other side of what they have to see the same with their complaints. Mark maybe or what they don't wanna go a certain way. It's very good to agree with them and to also get to understand why they're going that way and then. It's also going to go ahead and put to go ahead and and and. Thank you for your opinion is as to why you may need to see that they need a certain thing or. Why you need them to to do certain actions and I believe that's the best route that's course and everything in life. Period. It helps to build relationships and helps to keep relationships in the long run, Nestor out. We really want to take these days. Special attention being so high and everybody moving around fast paced on their cell phones and. Billy's ever so we always want to go ahead and an extended hand also listen to what they have to say. And kind of guide them into showing in lighting them in a way is saying. This is why we should probably go this route. And and it happened to work so the customer left at the store happy with the items purchased and very satisfied as far as him connecting that. To his cell Phone device and we were all happy at the very end and he was returned.	1
A situation where I. Positively. Affected others what comes to mind for me was when I was a teacher a special Ed Teacher, Hawaii. Went on a Field Trip with my students and it was just my other team partner an eye on the bus. With a deaf students and while we were on the bus. I noticed that the back of the bus. I'm trying to look foggy so I went and walked in the back of the bus and I noticed there was a little more smoke than they probably should have been. Try very calmly went up to the bus driver, before even telling my partner and I said, I really think we should. Pull over to the side. I see a lot of smoke and I'm concerned for my students so right away. The bus driver did that an and called in nine one. One just in case and I went back to my partner. And I said, We need to be very calm and let's get our children off this bus quickly tell him that. The Bass Pro, it's it's OK. It'll be alright. So I was able to get them off without quickly and it was a good thing because there was a small fire. They had started underneath underneath the car or the the box excuse me so I was so happy that I was. People too. Kind of take care of that situation, which was very stressful quickly and in a positive way so that my students were safe. And we got back to this folder principles had all the classes come out into the hallway and clap for us so. It was awesome.	1
I think being a supervisor in my last position. Being able to share. Field 19 and positive emotion, and and getting them to all work together. And using my influence to be able to have 4 fingers are closed. Most important thing because everybody has strengths and weaknesses and we put them all together and be able to. Have everybody come together and work at one. I think. And we have a leadership skills here able to do that easily be anything good in everybody in one everybody brings in detail.	1
I was once able to. Start a routine where I handed out letters to my customers and they were just are motivational letters that inspired positive iti. And it seemed caught on within the office and everyone was handing these little letters out to our customers and said to have a great day or it had a positive message on it or something personal. And it really inspired positive iti in the workplace and influence others to do better for our customers as well.	1
There was a time on an aircraft win. We had a delay in a lot of passengers thought that they weren't going to make it to their final destination. In enough time to make connection flight. So I got on the PA system and I let them know that everything will be taken care of. We only had a 15 minute delay that everyone will make their flight so all the people that were going to get up and get off of the flight. I felt a little bit better an I went through the aisles and I made sure that I let people know. And I just make sure that I looked at different flight times and let them know that if they didn't make their flight. There will be another one that will be 30 minutes to an hour after in that they would make it to their destination on time.	1
I'm when I was working in the cruise industry was actually at fraternal it was a very busy day. And we saw a lot of people coming in at a short period of time.

And make the day really a great day and we got all the people processed through and everybody was happy at the end of the day. I was proud of that.	1

So I currently own a hot yoga studio and we get customers in every day that we serve and sometimes miscommunications can occur. And people will be upset. We've had an unhappy customer come in lately and right away and I just listened. Instead of becoming defensive I just listen to the situation and slowly communicated gently starting with an apology and once I help set the tone the conversation from their completely turned around the customer. Realized it was just miscommunication and we were able to not only continue to work that solution, but we are also able to continue to talk thereafter. Dinner.	1
Hawaii my name is Andrea and I was a former music teacher, Anne used to conduct recipes wrestles with 150 and 200 students. And for choral performances. And I was very good at modeling how to present yourself on stage to smile, no matter what happened to the music. To keep a bit very positive attitude to keep the show going on, there and there was this one student. It was very shy didn't want to smile and with very hesitant perform, and I encourage the student. I took the student aside. I was able to reach reach the student emotionally enter engage and she did beautifully at the end of his. That's performance so I feel that I'm able to touch people, especially in times of stress in crisis. Thank you.	1
The situation, I was able to find the instance reaction and others. Through the scene. Um. Helping coworkers at work. To uh? Deliver the festival. Performance against Ann. Say. I work in a hotel so I can help you with some little bit. I work in a hotel so I guess with. Interaction with guests. If I had to do training of knew of. I will be training this new coworkers. Oh, I would give them advice is how to? Still, with some situations, they haven't done before. Or and I got. Positive. The actions that I'm not very good thing I guess.	1
A situation where I was positively influencing others would be at my first job, which wasn't an office setting. OK everyone in the office with all kind of. He used to being in the office. You know, and they're not used to interacting with people so there wasn't a lot of talking or? Say Hello and that type of thing, so I made it a point every day to come in and say hi and good morning. Everyone and smile at them and after a while. I notice that it kind of rubbed off on everyone else. And before I said. Good morning, they would say Good morning. To me or May. Sing a little bit more happy so I feel like I hope to the office as a whole and. I hope to become a lot more positive.	1
There was a situation where I was in. Line at the airport at a ticket gate. Podium regarding a delayed flight. Um having worked in the airline industry. I kind of know behind the scenes a little bit how. Information doesn't always pass right through to the gate agent. People were upset about the delays that were happening. They marketing information and as usually happens and took it out on the gate agent. I actually voiced my opinion that it's not her fault. She's doing the best. She can to get us. The information in a timely manner. And as soon as she knows something. So let us know. So we need to take a step back take a deep breath and as soon as she knows something. Well, No. Um. The tone of the people. Changed an I think. Calm down a bit so the situation was defused people weren't so angry. I think they just needed realization, check to realize that it's not the gate agent's fault. That, they're working on getting this information as soon as she can. So that did diffuse the situation. And as soon as she knew something we all knew things were calmer and things were quieter around the gate.	1
During my current job while in training. There was a situation where the class didn't feel comfortable with how the training was going. Ann wanted to quit. And I. Being the oldest in class at that time, and I took it upon myself to just say Hey, let's. Approach our trainers or management and tell them exactly what we need, and and let the training go that way instead of walking out of something that. Work so hard to get to. An and they appreciated that they appreciate me sort of talking them off the ledge and we went to our trainers. As a group and said this is what we need to succeed in this role to be better employees. To be better case managers to our members and they appreciated us doing that, and training went smoothly from that and. The girls in the class actually bought me a thank you card because they appreciated the fact that I. I took that time to help them see, things from another from another point of view.	1
At the leader I've had many opportunities to influence my staff and I can give you 1 situation hospital that I had range. This is lacking in several areas in their processes and following state sidelines. So I picked up on this so. Got together a team from my staff fixed. All the items that needed for medical into too much detail. Just simply because it's working in an operating room and I'm not not sure you know it's all medical language. Anyhow so. Please text the new policies and competencies and by positively employing some implementing all that when this taking the visit the Department of Health. And the Joint Commission on the accreditation of hospitals. Without flowering reviews in the operating room.	1
Suddenly, at my job and my health unit coordinator which means I'm basically the secretary to a whole entire hospital. And I was on the Hospice for this past week and I thought family of course, that was indeed. Pain is a family member one time so I took it upon myself. It was situational awareness where I went. And I looked it in the patients file to see what religion really work. So I could bring a priestess it with the family. And then I also got together, the team on that unit in the Hospice unit and we got the family card to say we're just thinking about. And if they need anything in that I'm a great just let us know will be there to support them 110%. And then we also got them in Angel pin because we knew a lot about their family member who is dying and they really, really believed in Angels? And we have their name engraved on it, so that my peers and everything for the family and even to us. So that's a cheap situation boys. Yes, they did have a loved one dying but positively we include them by having hope. Everybody was passionate passionate passionate and taking care of their loved one in that were there to support them 110%. And the door is always open for them to, if they needed anything and that was the positive influence that we had on others.	1
Hi. I went on a mission trip last year where I was. Helping kids 2. Adjust to flying back to the United States. With me and they were very scared in had never flown before our left their country. Hum. I was able to help them calm down by explaining everything that was going to happen on the flight and. Making it more exciting for them. That one experience that I've had recently that I wanted to share.	1
Service field for over 8 years and one day is the beauty supply and so one day we had a customer who wasn't happy. Without return policy so I'm the manager. So I spoke to our associate San explain to them that you know. We got signed up better accommodate her like you know, giving her a further discount or you know a gear store. Something special you know that will make her happier because you know, we don't want her to leave and the customer ended up being happy with what I suggested. And she left a good happy customer.	1
A situation in which I was able to positively influence the actions of others was when I was working at Universal Studios. In the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Parents one of my coworkers had Unfortunately just broken up with his boyfriend and I was able to talk to him. Kind of calm him down, make him realize that you know the world is not falling apart that everything will be OK. And just really talking to him and allow him to send really changed his work day and gave him a very positive. I work experience.	1
Information when I influenced the actions of others in a positive way was when I was working at Middlesex Hospital to hospital in Connecticut. Where I was on the PTR speed committees or practice committee for nurses that that was my profession and? We reviewed practice standards for nurses and help them improve their practice. We used peer reviewed literature in order to do that and we did case studies. Where in we reviewed specific cases in the hospital that I was working at where a nurse had submitted? How many asking whether or not uh standards of care were followed and what could it be? What could have been done better and if there was a safety event. Or, a protocol reached and we used several resources in order to do that research we use research we used. Prior case studies presidents in nursing practice and then we would disseminate that information back to the person who started the ticket and they report it to their manager and it would be disseminated back to all the. Uh people under them and their practice with well, they would be encouraged to improve their practice as a result of our recommendations so that would be. An example of positively impacting the activity of others.	1
So as many of you guys were not know my name is Luis Roldan am actually one of the ways that I've. Can a positive influence on others? Is buyouts actually a post myself survivor and after being a survivor? I went ahead and started motivational speaking. An I spoke around the world I spoke about. Pause of love peace for positive iti and also worked a lot with gun violence on reinforcement and vitamins almost here in the state of Florida. A few ways that I did that I went to high school and I spoke to a lot of kids and I spoke about. You always wear. Hope you know 'cause I lost my friends in my partners and actually I was into an argument that night. And. You know, I wanted my speeches. I spoke about you know always keep moving forward. You know forgive people never forget. But you know little things like arguing and stuff like that is not really good also I worked with some balance when I was doing whatever. So speaking and when I spoke you know on TV and stuff, I spoke about why it's important to reduce. Please call Browns and ways to be involved in. You know it was a great impact a lot of kids and adults both reach back to us and. Love to Share your story and also on ways to make things better.	1
A time that I was able to positively influence influence the actions of others. Was when I was still working on? The Ram as a ramp agent for Delta Global Services. I come into work I was still working, the night shift in one of our flights had canceled. And so I wanted to see a counter and I came in around 8:00 o'clock 'cause I wanna schedule 2. Be there. And I saw a huge line of passengers and 40 or 50, maybe even more bag sitting. Hum. Sitting behind the counter, so I had gone back into the bag. And inside the people who were pulling bags off of the bag cards to bring them up to the passengers. I had gotten the other ramp agent, I was like I told them. We need to help them out there. There's 100 passengers and there's 100 bags and if we go out there and help them we can get everybody. Really need to go get them their bags back and help make the situation a little bit easier and. Once he got everybody out there. We were calling names finding people and giving them their bags and they actually explain to us how to? Destroy a bag tag in our system so that when they came back in the morning, they wouldn't have to. Paper that bag and 2nd time. And once we had everybody out there working together and getting people their bags and destroying bag tags. I believe that we have this situation. Under control and everybody was on their way to a hotel or back to their house whether they were leaving from. Ohio or they were returning to where they were from probably within about 1/2 an hour and when I showed up there was only one gate agent. Counter and after I've gone back and gotten everybody else, we had about 3 or 4 people up front. Helping passengers in assisting them in getting their bags. I'm getting them. Really needed to go and I feel like it made a lot of people happy and it definitely need to get agent happy because she had to help that she. We're definitely needed.	1
To make sure. I previously. And my current my previous role. I had to probably influence others by taking on a leadership role so basically I was training. The employees on how and how to do the daily duties of the job and by that I had to. Be very positive very, very influential. So that the new hires would understand how to do their job and also do it in officially manner. So, in that instance. I have to be a really great leader very passionate about what I'm doing and passionate about teaching others how to? Do their job properly so that'll. Post a positive effect on the company as well.	1
Having been in leadership and management things like that, and I found that the most successful leadership and radio. Sending you just wanted me to example an do it today after two click done and people usually follows. And also that it would be delegating asking people asking me to join Indian include are invite her and giving them. Encourage me to join you or Hey? Can you help me people always say they want to help if you ask so just knowing how to approach people in a way home. An engineering and then make it be right in front and rewarding even in small ways and also the big ways. So the other things, too, and is just offering your current credit to them offering an everything criticism. I guess critique you know. Hany you know can you sing another way, I like to do it and see if it might make it? Search for things like that that encourage them to pursue it for themselves and take accountability and also take. Join writing and work well done at that you know, volunteering doing service Department along those lines, but I just think that. Clean my example is probably the number one way to get others to participate and also to ensure the standards. I guess a big difference day, so that if I'm just going in what's expected. Do they know what to do and we can also. So precision suggested they made no better way to do it, but at least it gives us a good starting around and we can analyze how it's going and you have it's an ongoing situation or process. In Japan.	1
A situation when I was able to positively influence others. That would definitely be situation at work. Everyone was having a really, really rough day. And I only happened to come in a little bit later in the day. Ann. I'm with my personal memory of B. Outgoing person and When I saw that he was very upset and mad. I was just thinking, you know what can I do to? Help everyone out if you will so I decided to buy everyone. Jaguar box rather of Donuts. And just turn right today little bit and I just told you know it will get better. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. And. That. It's not the end of the world. I think today. Most everything's doing better you just have to see it ruined. So for this at the end of day so. That was weird.	1
Well, there was a situation while working on a normal healthy and it as a nurse. Where there was a patient who had just come on to the unit and she was? Not there by choice, she came in kicking and screaming and she was. Clearly very scared to be there and. A lot of my coworkers responded to the situation with exasperation 'cause that is something that we see quite often on the mental health unit people that. After in such ways, but I tried my best to treat the patient as an individual, not just another one patient who acted that way. An I you know talked to her in a calming manner, an I told her that she is safe. And I've tried to do everything I could to make her comfortable even when she was screaming at me, I got her extra pillows. I got her water. And I got her situated into a room, which is not common practice usually we doing assessment in it. Medical examination room, impatient there admitted but I knew that would make her even more uncomfortable so I took her straight to her room. And it actually did work out very well after I got on her level. I don't try and talk to her in that calming and therapeutic manner, she was able to come down. Without the use of medication, which my Co workers were preparing to give her I always think that it's good, too. Tell you help people without medication 'cause it doesn't really. Get to the root of the issue. It's much better to just talk to them and try to resolve the situation in that manner so. I was able to positively influence that patient stay on the unit.	1
And then um. I can say that I've probably positively influence the actions of others. I work in security industry for a about 10 years and I had the opportunity of serving up their supervisor. An uhm. There was a situation where any individual in the building that I was working in managing had approached the front desk. It started speaking abruptly to one of the security guards. And. The security guard was young, she did not understand you know why this. Employee was yelling at her so I took it upon myself to step into the situation to show them exactly. How to handle a situation in that matter so the first thing I did was introduce myself to the employee? And it's often employed actively what seems to be the problem. The second was to come. You know, having understanding and try to give the employees some type of understanding on what up. The issue at hand was and how we're going to rectify it and. Last but not least the actions that came out of it was the employee had the opportunity to apologize to. My employee and Mindfully had the opportunity to see how to handle a situation. You know on A at needed basis.	1
So I actually used to work at a daycare that's my most recent job that I've had, and it was such a delight working with the children. I love kids so much. And I was able to positively influence them everyday watch them grow everyday watch them learn how to do simple things like. Spell your name read so that was probably the most positive action that I've ever done. Hum. To this date, so yeah, thank you.	1
In the current role that I have is office. Manager I faced with that situation on a day-to-day basis my. Attitude. I see more often than not influences the way you know, my employees work and it kind of sets the tone for the whole day. I've always been a firm believer that it's positive. Iti radiates an I think people can see that and notice that and then they kind of vibe off of your enerji. Also being in the service industry prior to this just doing small things for guests can really. I feel like amplify their experience and make them want to come back and. You know, making it more personalized if they were celebrating something special or I would do everything in my power to make it special for them because. I mean, who doesn't want that in customer service, you know at the end of the day I think treating people how you want to be treated. In a certain industry or something like that, if they can see that you're genuine and that your positive I think they? Really relate to that and I think it makes for an all over better experience not only just. When you're working but also whenever you're out and about and I just think. Any situation if you radiate positivity and it really shows.	1
Well, as the Oh. Former flyer tendon in the past. I had a many times to change lanes. Other possibly on situations where there was a lot of stress. And because of the timing. No dynamic in there, fast, Ethernet link above on the Erling so in those situations where we were kind of. Traffic was very a lot a lot of going on. I'm I'm painting positive attitudes always having a smile. I try my face high def. She did to others to imitate that and so continue to work as a team and. Of course, you want this team together and happy, yeah, I'll come. It's very, very. So. That is the situation that I can think of right now, I'm realizing it.	1
So one situation, which I was able to positively influence action of others was when I was working as a flight line supervisor. At an FBO we had uh a large crew, but fairly new a lot of them are very new. A lot of them didn't really know how to really kind of take initiative or move forward in there. Daily their day-to-day activities. There they were kind of just sit and wait for things to happen and so I took. All of them together and try and told him that you know you shouldn't have to wait for something. To happen in order to respond to it, there's always something to do there's always. You know, some sort of proactive step that you can take like if we know an aircraft is coming in. And they are of a certain size of a certain weight or anything, you can press the equipment that we would need to service the aircraft. Or if you as soon as we get an aircraft in we should always be ready with a luggage cart. And things that we know that you know the passengers might need so that we don't have to sit there and. Wait, for them to ask us for the things that we are pretty certain that they're going to ask for. And just be more proactive in their day-to-day rolls at the FBO an I think that influence them very positively because we are performance improves from that point on. And I think a lot of the guys really appreciated kind of guidance in that way so they're not just kind of sitting around. And kind of wondering what to do or sitting around and and kind of not doing anything at all. And there's always something that can be done at work for sure.	1
There have been several situations where I've had the opportunity to kind of coach my fellow partners at Starbucks. In kind of the proper way, and either making drinks so the proper way and. Kaden saying. Make the drinks in order to get them out the most effectively. Um. What I would do is? Uh. I would kind of. Ask them just to make sure that I was observing that they were doing it incorrectly and we kind of. Ask then Oh how many pumps of syrup in that or how many shots did you put in there. And. If they answered Maine look like the incorrect in there, I would always try to kind of coach that and be like, Oh this is the correct way to do it this is. But you should be doing. And after that, they've corrected it and it's a good way to help others kind of learn and grow as well.	1
And I have been in this situation multiple times where I can or have been in this situation, too positive. Positively influence the actions of others and for example, and I work in an optical currently and so whenever people come in. And some patients can be irritable and you know they just want to get in and out the door. They don't want to wait. And so I I can always feel that when they come in so one thing that I always try to do. Ann is just make conversation after holiday news as soon as it's there. All stay ask them how their summers going if they have any vacation. An planned so and whenever you do that with people I've learned that you can just really get them too. You know be on a positive note get them on their good side and make their waiting times a positive time. And not have to you know go through the stress and the hassle of being at the doctor and all the nerves and. You know the inconsistency so that would be a situation that was great.	1
UH-1 situation that I was able to probably influence the actions of others. Was I would have to say in sports? I was? Selected with you, girl to go an do a volleyball tournament in Florida, an we were getting a little discouraged because we weren't. The best and weren't doing. All that great, but I no matter the negativity that surrounded the situation, I was. Uplifting everyone I was dancing, we were doing little freestyles. Oh, and that ultimately change the mood of everyone and we started doing better and we won our first game. After that, so it was really exciting and so very proud of that moment.	1
Hi so I'm positively influencing the actions of others. I think that a smile or a happy word is. Just very encouraging and can set the mood for people, you're around, especially in the workplace, so you know if. Let's say I was at work and everyone wasn't doing so great and I just smiled encourage them ask them if there's anything they needed. I think that positively influence them so.	1
A situation of which I have the chance to influence. Others is a job that I have and I currently have. As an instructor at a vo Tech Vocational Technical School teaching cosmetology every day, I get to work with young people. And really mold them into great hair stylists in for me that is really rewarding. I love passing on my knowledge to others. And I'd love to see when these houses go out and. Create these amazing careers and in I'd like to think that I have a little part of that, so that is extremely rewarding for me. On a daily basis.	1
Hello I would like to share the do Part 1 situation once. We had huge delay and the state on board the passengers like around. 5 hours. And I saw how my my colleagues are a little bit exhausted and tired what I've done, I just. I walk in the cabin Anna started talk to passengers an shares with them about my travel and experience. How it's amazing and some of them they were going to charge and her head connecting flight so I told him we can eat traditional food and. She like amazing historical places when Michael legs, so that in me, they they they started to do the same thing and they join me. In the cabin and they started to share with the passengers about their experience. I was for delighted that Michael and help me and I'm much rain to them to pass these difficult time because I know everybody is exhausted and 5 hours is quite a lot. And the passages dissatisfied and my colleagues. They they told me that I give them with example? How to By the time instead of just sitting all just waiting and listen to a passenger how they had said so. It was a good motivation for them, an very good here and thank you.	1
I think it's time when I was able to make a positive influence with probably. Most recently throughout College. I was more of the kind of Take Charge and lead groups, a lot and kind of motivated Groupon. Looking for long time. Hum. I really feel like I really impacted a lot of students to help them succeed and perform as well as we could together.	1
A situation in which I was able to. Positively influence their actions of others would be with my. Last job, I was just a part of and it was the fire service. So within the fire service, we would show up to school. Teach him a little bit about fire safety. Stop drop and roll in. With that we get to teach them to not play with sliders. Small things like don't take over the camels or don't leave them on or if you see one on and no one else is around maybe blow it out. That. Little tidbits here and there. The little kids truly take home with them. And they are able to positively. Impact the life of their family their household and those kids. Go home and teach their parents of these things. And it just. Goes on from generation to generation and within the fire service through able to positively influence the actions of others. Every day that we were at work. Just by being there for them supporting them, letting them know that we were there for them.	1
Actor Johnny currently work at. We also have to give out like samples and. I'm all for new products to our customers and a lot of the time it kind of is like them. Asking your opinion and. I'm asking you if you like it or in your favorite. So I'll give them my response and then I kind of get to see how they feel about when they take their they try it. For example, any products.	1
So I went home. I used to be a passenger service at the airport and assume there's a situation. Most of coworkers. They don't know what to do 'cause they're nervous. For the passenger if it's a situation that's never happened before. So I took action, but I needed my coworkers to help me out. Well, so I said, Hey, baby, can you help me do this here Maria can you help me do the other thing while I go get the supervisor? And everybody flipped. With a positive 5 to help it Packer passenger in their family. So let me free.	1
Yes, I had a situation once where I had 2 children with down the road, he was sick. Before passing by an I had the opportunity to help him and I called from and stayed with him until the Amazon fire trucks got there. And they ended up taking him to the hospital and he's doing much better now.	1
I feel like I can name a number of situations where I've had the opportunity to positively influence home. Other people, whether it be in school and school setting works church anywhere. I do too. I think my personality issues. I'm expression approachable person, I physically have such a pleasant date, so season 2. Charlie tells me so I think you know for example, if I smile at someone, and they just smiled back. Maybe they weren't having a great day. So it looks like in a word situation, I would say. Um. I would say I'm actually. A team leader at my job like I work directly under my manager so. There is literally a number of situations that are getting them again. So I don't know where is it? But it's really just in everyday life, I can. I think I am a positive improvement to other people? I like conversation, I don't think there's any automatic saving. Hope you like it, too short so.	1
So I didn't bring my last job, then I was cashier and my my my manager. He was he was super busy. And then like he was he was doing something else but I customer was waiting to talk with him. And then on my other collecting stars, but I think that you can try to talk with him and then. See what's going on and then maybe maybe you can try help nothing I think I think I can do that. I'm going to try. And then I I went back to the customer and I was. I say so like he's a little busy right now? Is there anyway that I can help you. And then you go no like I just I just want that once you ask him, he are you guys hiring because. I really want to work in the company and blah blah blah and then I was thinking. I. Like I was super hand because I helped him and then my other friends. They served I know you can do it just. Just go there and talk to him and then I was like I said, I was happy because I was. Able to help him.	1
Situation where I was able to positively positively influence the actions of others would be. Doing my cherry meant positions for the Tyler Area Chamber of Comers Membership Services Committee. As a chair leg is my duty to motivate the Contacts up numbers. To help them reach their goals. Which. In return will help which to me of the chair leg in my chair return those though. Uhm I motivate them by sending emails. Following up after monthly meetings and offering assistance if needed, so that they are able to reach that goes. And in return. Are most of our contact club members? Are those that are? Um. Interested in staying in reaching their goals have met their those and. I'd like to think that was with. The help of my with my leadership.	1
During my time in ABA therapist. There are many times where I could possibly impact, selective another I work with children. And because of that each day was different. One particular time, whereas possibly impact, Verizon and others like when I talked a client of mine Mac actors. Really, he overcame the challenges as he took each day step by step and work towards harder better help him in the way that he needed personally. And when I took him to his qualities as a. Little boy and what his interests were an applied applied that to my math program for him, he slowly. He came to develop that like in the idea of math and after 3 weeks. It took him now, he loves doing that. He had fun doing it and I think I was really awesome and I hope that he goes places in there. That will be huge in his future.	1
So a situation where I was parked where I was able to positively positively impact the actions of others and the first thing that comes to mind is. When I was in college. I was on a mission trip power volunteer trip to New Orleans, where we worked with the youth and did. Different activities to promote financial literacy, literacy, and your design education methods and goals. While we were there. Everybody was pretty tired and cranky. We were waking up around 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning. And then not really being able to go to bed until maybe like one or 2 because we had a lot of volunteering opportunities going on. And the report was really, really low at one point and I feel like you know something came over me and I was just super excited too. Bring the group back together and how to remind everybody that we were here. So I started uh I pulled a group together and I said, Hey Let's. You know it all sit down living room and let's have a power after dinner, so after dinner, we all sat and just kind of December Cardean. Some of the challenges that they were going through to make their day, not go so great and you know. I think the part myself so just kinda remind everybody about some great moments that happened throughout the day will be 5 people. Calling or kicking up dust and we're just so you know full and happy and open with us and. I really do feel like I truly try to ship around and it made it was moving forward and. It was one of the best experiences I had in college for sure.	1
Try OK this is an easy one, I've been a fitness instructor for 37 years and every single thing I do. Is washed very carefully? I am in charge of leading people through exercise very safely very effectively and with funds. It has pretty fun or people won't come back. And I have been very successful at that for a long time, and that has allowed other people too. No improve their health and Wellness, but also have a sense of camaraderie has something to look forward too. Sometimes they're exercise classes for racial part of their day. I've always taken a lot of joy in doing that and so positively influencing other people have been part of my lifestyle. 37 years and counting.	1
So a few years ago, I moved out to Brooklyn, NY to help open up a bar as their venue manager and lead bartender turned out. Hum. And in the hiring process we were able to recruit people that kind of shared our vision for what the hospitality of the bar was going to. Do you like in the environment that we wanted to know how for our customers and so through training and? Implementing my own you know systems and standard operating procedures. I was able to kind of. Help influence all of my staff members to create the environment and just come robbery. Amongst ourselves, but also amongst the atmosphere of the entire bar and restaurant that we were going for so that was a huge opportunity for me. And something I was very, very proud of. To be able to kind of you know take all the hospitality experience that I have through manage another bars, but actually be able to be. At a new place from the beginning and help help guide new bartenders new servers in the way that. I personally like to Exude Hospitality, which is you know very customer focused. And Yeah, you see wonderful opportunity for me.	1
Anytime I employed someone is in a positive manner that I'm sending positive tone and that I. Really, thinking positive messages across. For a situation in which? I positively influence people's actions. Was? My freshman year of college had a small Catholic University. Going with small Catholic University, there's not much diversity. Bye I took that infest types. It seems to me to be able to teach people who may not have experience. Black gay man before. So is able to. Chico spot, which become actions that people may have. And. Allow them to know that asking questions OK. Learning is OK. That when you want to learn about somebody says the best positive thing you can do because it breaks down. Boundaries. And opens up doors of conversation allow people to circulate comfortable with one another. So the situation being. Survivors. The action rifle was opening up disappearance in creating a gay club on encountered Reversi approved. For the first time. And I've been allowed students coming out. Health tap Catholicism in religion intertwined with. Homosexuality. And really start getting the conversation diversity moving on Camera.	1
A time when I was able to positively influence the action of feathers. I was or I currently am a limo driver at winning encore and we were going through a really. Busy moment where there was a lot of different guests coming out at the same time, we had a lot of cars lined up. Ready to handle that, but was a little chaotic and so I was able to. Kind of like charge of the situation and I I didn't take a ride and I. I sort of navigated everybody and made sure all the guests out in. It's hyper cars and got the drivers going with everybody. It was just chaotic and I think the drivers were. Kind of stuff they didn't know what gets to take they didn't know if the guess was actual qualified to take a car. I'm sorry I was able to get on the Phone with dispatch and kind of navigate that whole situation. And just got the guest out of there in a timely manner, but I think I kind of jump started everybody's attitude. I got them going 'cause again. Everybody was just kind of 2nd standing around so that was the time that. I think I influenced by the actions of others.	1
Hello sorry about that for this question. I have to relate back to my job when I was selling by the sleep number part of that job was. Working on a team and we used to practice our sales what they called selling by numbers and a part of that was. Really being able to listen and have empathy for our customers as they came in and another part of that was being able to give. Constructive criticism to our other employees so that way we could work together and build each other up and make sure that when our customers came in We were prepared. And so in order to do that, we would come in act as if we were a customer and then give feedback. And a hard time with that, you know with certain employees was that they didn't know how to I guess communicate. Or take that feedback so something that I've had to learn how to do was. Incorporate humor, but also incorporate their positive so you know, making sure you give somebody. What they're doing right 1st and then of course where they can you know correct themselves obviously we're working on a team? It sounds like for new to sales so you know was our answer always correct. Maybe not, but it was good to go through this scenario, so that way. When we were practicing or did have the actual cell coming through we would know a different answer or a way to overcome. An objection you know, closing the sale is very hard specially when you're selling $10,000 beds and so. Team being able to construct the feedback and then of course, landing the smell out of that.	1
I like to consider myself as a leader so a situation where I was able to pass it possibly. Influence the actions of others comes to me a lot. The first thing that popped into my mind to do a lot of work in the community in Philadelphia. Area. Uh with my organization, so we do a lot of events for the homeless population. I go around I. Raise donations for toiletries for clothes or shoes. Um. And we go out to the community and we deliver these bags, so it with. Toiletries T shirt socks everything that they need we deliver food. And we just have good conversation and it's very positive environment another situation. I am currently director at a day care if I do a lot of work with the use. And we took the kids over to the community park. I really the only. Day care center in the park at the time picking up trash, so we had a community service day. And we had other children in the park who we didn't even know Joyner so I'm I'm big on leadership. I'm big on positive iti inspiring others being a positive influence to everybody around.	1
Integrity is a big part of who I am and those items in contact with me. You can read that right off that whether they're in processing or they're working with me. The time that I was able to positively influence someone else's actions, but I've worked for Universal Studios. We had I had been approached with a not necessarily problem, but it could have been a problem I approached it. Yeah, again team member and I basically sat down with the maximum Hey? How are you OK everything alright? That person ended up not going through with what they were thinking of going through it in Russia thing about stealing from the company. And it was just sort of cash and I will be able to help them. And people sometimes over rough times in their financial situations and I'm glad that I was able to guide them in a different direction of the poster them stealing the company ultimately getting fired because. I wouldn't have been able to just let it happen.	1
I was a part of a sorority in college and every year, you have to do recruitment and I remember. Last year in particular, the very first day you have to do the same thing over and over and over again. And I was known to be the girl that always kind of encourage people to like keep their energy up. That we were almost done only 4 more parties 3 more parties like we had to make sure that we were full of energy. And I was able to influence those actions of the other girls from. So that we would all be the most energetic that we could and the happiest that we could and I was really cool. Knowing that I was able to do that. For my friends. Keep everyone's. Energy up and yeah.	1
So one situation, which I was able to positively influence action of others was when I was working as a flight line supervisor. At an FBO we had uh a large crew, but fairly new a lot of them are very new. A lot of them didn't really know how to really kind of take initiative or move forward in there. Daily their day-to-day activities. There they were kind of just sit and wait for things to happen and so I took. All of them together and try and told him that you know you shouldn't have to wait for something. To happen in order to respond to it, there's always something to do there's always. You know, some sort of proactive step that you can take like if we know an aircraft is coming in. And they are of a certain size of a certain weight or anything, you can press the equipment that we would need to service the aircraft. Or if you as soon as we get an aircraft in we should always be ready with a luggage cart. And things that we know that you know the passengers might need so that we don't have to sit there and. Wait, for them to ask us for the things that we are pretty certain that they're going to ask for. And just be more proactive in their day-to-day rolls at the FBO an I think that influence them very positively because we are performance improves from that point on. And I think a lot of the guys really appreciated kind of guidance in that way so they're not just kind of sitting around. And kind of wondering what to do or sitting around and and kind of not doing anything at all. And there's always something that can be done at work for sure.	1
I think there were several situations where I was you know task with influencing others. A lot of times it was at the Disneyland resort. Where I was Assistant Fire Chief? One that stands to mind is we had a family who is daughter was kind of end of life. Small child about 5 or 6 years old. They do not qualify for make A wish trips and what I was able to do was through connections. From my customer service classes that I went to the task was we needed to provide this family with as much. Support and Then overall great customer experiences as we could So what I did is I leveraged all my Contacts. I got front of the line passes from guest services. I got some plush toys and some other little trinkets from my friends at merchandising, the stores. I was able to secure some meals. From my friends at dining and some front row seats preferred seats for entertainment, from my friends in. In the entertainment business part of the park and we were able to provide this family with just an absolute wonderful memorable. From experience.	1
Hi I was able to influence the actions of others when I worked as a term her baby. And I was working with the patient. However, the family was not happy with the care that he was receiving. So I thought that was their best interest for us to allow us to do our job and it was our number one priority. To keep the nation safe. So after talking about going over with the safety and the needs of the page and we were able to convert from that. Leaving them inside the facility was the best action possible. Thank you.	1
Good evening. Being a planner tenant we get to. Have passengers look to us at all times during RJ during our day weather. We're in the airport whether we are. On the shuttle bus or whether we are on the airplane. All too often some of our passengers will ask. What what should they do regarding connecting flights regarding baggage claim I probably transportation issues? How should they get? To their ultimate destination. Most expeditiously. Hum. But also with the experience of having it in flight crew member told them of. The easiest way to navigate your friends I've seen this play out in various situations to wear. Passwords are vast Maine on the airplane. Michael what do I do when I get to Chicago where am I? Flight has been either delayed or cancelled. Often, I will direct them to the airlines. Internal mechanisms for managing their reservation such as a mobile app or something like that. But I'll tell them occasionally but like you know, maybe it's best to contact reservations or. Um. Come up with another mode of Transportation if need be, but they looked at us, sometimes too. Um be there guiding principle and reading their guiding star. An I've seen a lot of people who said that they've taken my recommendations. And then this is worked out for them, so it is nice to have a positive influence in past years lives. Thank you.	1
Hello Scott, a situation in which they were able to positively influence the actions of others. I'm so me personally, I used to do a lot of motivational speaking or kind of mentoring your wedding night. I'm index rating for the last 5 years and I used to teach people all over the world how they treated well. Had over 350 students and throughout my course of actually teaching on Facebook and through these times. I'm with day trading anything outside of the normal typical job. It's a string down the entrepreneurial path, it's not necessarily. You know show up and get paid you know just go through the motions and get paid a lot of it comes with personal development just having the right mindset in order to succeed. So what I would do is not only with you know, not not only what I study and analyze my charger. Actually be like be the role model with a front liner tag for the ready to actually attack the markets the financial market. What I'll do is I'll share my results with others from this way inspiring basically to ask me questions or. Ask her what are you doing, and then I expose other people to the financial world as well? When I do without mentioning on health and hold these people standing on it, too. You know that educate them on the matter. Of course, they have to want to you know to succeed, as well. When they actually go through material states, but basically what I do is. I do, I do the role model. I expose people to they don't mention holding hands and through guard duties courses and Whatnot. I've actually helped I know at least. 7 people make over $10,000 and I thought these people. Still, like I never even knew about. Or I was never exposed to and without me, making the first steps to actually pursue this path. So it's kind of like a domino effect. I started it and help other people succeed.	1
And so the question is to describe a situation in which I was able to positively influence others. I actually get to do that. About 4 times a weekly basis. I'm actually a behavioral use counselor so it is my job to positively influence. Kids that I work with kids I work with a range from. Home to 13 years old just today. Today I generally help my kids with things like temperament and decision making. But just doing things right from wrong, a lot of these kids come from backgrounds where they haven't had. A positive adult figure in their lives on just an example of a situation at it, I'll get frustrated last week. Because he was struggling to do something else because cleaning his room and 1st. She's really upset because I don't understand that. He's never been taught this and gave that he was certain age, I expected him to do you know how to do something? Is it talking things through and getting to understand one another better? I was able to help him and teach him? How to go about things correctly and it ended up being a positive experience for everybody and in turn I also built more of her. I work with my clients so. That's definitely one of the few times that I've been able to positively impact my kids at work.	1
So when I was in the Navy at my job wasn't inflate technician an as unemployed. Technician my job is to fix whatever is broken on the plane. Whether it's before, during or after the flight just to make sure that we're prepared and so. Before the flight, we would we had an issue, one time where one of the critical equipment was down. And I had no other option. We had to fix that before we could fly, otherwise you wouldn't be able to fly. And the pilots were on us like we need to take off and either take off. And instead of just like jumping in there like OK well. You're in charge like let me just do whatever you want. I had to sit down. I had to calm red flame to the pilots like Sir. I'm really. I really apologize that we have to. You know the way the flight, but it's gonna take me 20 more minutes. Then, like to fix this piece of equipment and then we can fly safely. It won't break the entire flight and then we will have to come home early. And so I think that positively influence their actions to delay the flight 20 more minutes. Even though that's not what they wanted to do and that's not like. Actually, that's all anybody wanted to do everybody wanted us to take off and everybody had a lot of pressure on me to get the equipment working. Alright influence there. Actions to allow me to finish my job and to make sure that the equipment was 100% safe. Before moving forward because I wanted to make sure that during the flight and post light. I will going to have to. Either turn the plane around early or. Will stay all night trying to fix this piece of equipment in order to come back tomorrow to fly again. So I think that is where I really positively influenced pretty much the entire crew to delay the flight.	1
Alright, a situation that I've been into positively influence actions of others. I've been a trainer at many of the restaurants that I worked at an exciting to get new people and he's making other surface or or never served in such a high volume. Play. And just get them interacting and more comfortable with our customers. Can loosen them up make them feel that they were going to be good at her job? Launch hearing and just trying to brighten someones day. You don't know anybody's going through. So anything you can do to turn their day upside down, make them smile make them believe that they can do something it's just great.	1
The way I was able to positively positively change the actions of others. I was actually on a flight. To Sturgis SD and we were in a extremely bad hell storm. I had 2 children, sitting next to me to actually replying alone. Uhm I am a mother so I felt like I was able to calm the people in front of them. And behind them and the 2 children and make them feel a little bit more comfortable a man also we had someone who is extremely. Angry that was sitting across the aisle from me. That was very livid because there were 2 children on the plane by themselves and they were crying extremely upset. I was able to call him and hopefully influence them to make them have a happier trip. and I was just a passenger at that point so. It made me feel really good.	1

The person who replicate she was so nervous because the game ultimately relied on her if we were able to take home the championship trophy or not. So I was able to you know talk to her and calm her down, like you know just practice what we practice. All the time we are able to do and in practice, so I'm more than sure that you're able to do it in the game. So just have confidence in yourself and believe that you can do it and I'm more than sure you can succeed. And when she went out there, she was able to kick it in the outfield in the bar wasn't caught. And was able to bring in 2 home runs and we won the championship trophy.	1

Yes, I was searching in 2005 in Colorado Springs and one of the time. In the morning, we would do exercises under the weather when it's snowing or raining and as a leader. You know, I compromise soldiers and I told. Talk to them and tell him that you know after RPT I can take you guys ask for. Pizza or something like that, you just have to keep them all comfort an. Give them something that they want to hear after fits in you know after the PTR the exercise that was over. They were so excited and said Oh my gosh, we like working with Sergeant Albert An. Ever, after after that, they just keep coming back for for more feature with me instead of the other surgeon.	1
The situation that I was saying. Then I published was able to influence others around me was a situation where actually I was in a training. And he was going to training and of course, it was more like a scavenger hunt. And we was using survivor, they gave us the Bible of tools to use while we was Alan C. And so when I did, um instead of trying to find the tools or whatever the we need to. To survive I said less time lemonade. This would do elimination. Let's see what is the least tool that we need to survive? So by doing that, if I said, OK, and I said, so we like the minimal tools that we need to buy. Do not need to survive then we can go with those that we do need to survive on so. Everybody agree with it, it's called illumination police. I think that we need to survive it.	1
There are many situations that come to mind when answering this question. But when situation. I'd like to go ahead and touch on. Where I was able to positively influence the actions that others would be at my current job now working in the medical field. Finding the cover for date approached me and let me know that she wasn't having a great day. I let her know everything was going to be OK and then I take on all of her tasks and responsibilities. This shows that I was able to learn helping here in a hard situation. And that she did feel better instantly.	1
Yes, I had a situation once where I had 2 children with down the road, he was sick. Before passing by an I had the opportunity to help him and I called from and stayed with him until the Amazon fire trucks got there. And they ended up taking him to the hospital and he's doing much better now.	1
My with Macy's. Um. I think one of the biggest influences that I had in creating a positive influence was creating the my Macy's strategy. Across all of these stores in creating the the coach to coach to creating one of the cases initiatives.

Calories making long lasting relationships with our customers and creating a customers to converting them into client and remaking them repetitive.

A situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others was when I worked at Wells Fargo as a teller. A lot of customers didn't like when the line would get so long and we were short staffed so I encouraged my. Management to try to save most of us on the busiest days and how a state in the lobby because. It was so important to me that we were making the customers happy and proud to be a part of our company so the customers. There, as well, I made sure that I let them know that'd be great and it would bring so much positivity to at this thing. Time. Time is money it is so important. A lot of people don't like to wait and they have so much going on in their lives. I'm just seeing understanding and being able to provide check the littlest bit of support with so important, and it also made a huge influence. On my coworkers as well as we weren't able to rapidly go through our customers and it was awesome. I definitely enjoyed bringing that positive influence to my workplace.	1
Well, one situation is I currently drive a school bus for special needs children and one of my students. It has a hard time in the morning transitioning school. It's not his favorite thing, so I have discovered some of his favorite types of music and what channel. Define them on so when he gets on the bus. I usually Tom Good morning. And he knows we're going to have fun doing this cool. And part of the spine is I'm like Hey? Can you go ahead and put your music on we put this music on an he's great? Now sometimes we Steven it's not so great, so he'll sit down. I'll let him just chill for a minute or 2. I'll check with him on my team still wanna listen to your channel. And he'll tell me yes and he automatically knows now if he's kinda Grouchy and not smiling at me. That I'm gonna let somebody else listen to their channels and he already and me, and him already have this kind of agreement. So what I basically do is look back at him call out his name and say, Hey, how you doing. Do you want me to change the channel he's like no let's just leave it there until smile at me? And then from the rest of the time me and all the other kids. We just jam out and have fun with his way on. Looks cool and that's how I change that situation to him, having a graduate. Right the best. Sending him getting to school and being happy 'cause it's. It's fine being a bus driver and making sure that you impact them and make sure they start their game. Pay off right.	1
In previous jobs, I worked at a non-profit called hope communities. I absolutely adored it and as it was a nonprofit are gold. To help people and a tremendous amount of time working with the children. It was very rewarding. Basically, I designed and implemented all of their programs.

One of our business bankers actually had left the company and so. You know, no one was able to learn the business banking part of of of the financial institution and So what I did is. You know, I sat down my manager and I told him Hey, you know, I want to. You know to step up and take action and and either 1, two to help these business clients and so. When that When that question came up, I was the one who went to all the the training and and and went.

So the first thing the parents of the children would see. Um. I was the first, the first one, said to be there, I was the head of the class. So it's very important to be positive and have a positive actions and. Because I My actions would trickle down to the children and parents. And so I remember in the middle of the year 1 teacher she. She got another job somewhere else and I had to step in. And. For that class in the middle of the year and it was very hard at first too. To get these these parents on these children to get used to me. And so I would just be positive and everything an also I had to be positive for my my. My assistant teacher. So she was relying on me as well, an eventually we all we all. Got to know each other and the parents were very comfortable with me in the end and the kids loved me. So I feel like it's very important to. To be positive and You know in everything that you do in life. It's Very important to know that your actions affect other people. Ann.

A time where I was able to pause it to positively influence the action of others was when I was working at Lynnwood Teriyaki Grill. Last year, my sister who was also my co-worker accidentally had an accident. She got her finger cut when she was chopping some meat. And when when this happened, all my coworkers or panicking and freaking out. I was there and I was able to assess the situation and I've tried my best to deescalate the situation. I made sure that everyone would calm down and then I went back and got her first aid kids. Made sure. She was OK and then it was very bad because her cut with deeper than we thought so we got her. To the hospital. And being able to positively influence others to be calm and relaxed, so that we could. We could help each other.	1
Yes, I did turn it right now and we had a bunch of delays one night. And there is an autistic kid on board. Another budget and it was very nervous and the mom was worried about the situation. So I personally have had experience with autistic children, my cousin is autistic.

Max and rings just to make sure that he was comfortable and understanding what was going on and that we were trying to help the situation as much as possible to get us. Back to get him back to his home.	1
Hi Yes, that comes from my volunteering with children and giving them the positive reinforcement and providing them with. Tools to really appreciate what they brought to the table because these were children network were actually in I would say more. We are difficult neighborhoods or you know high risk area, so coming in and working with these kids and giving them the ability and the encouragement. To appreciate any little thing they did, and holding it also accountable for any mistakes. They did was an extremely amazing outcome. These kids really loved it. It got to the point where they actually nominated me for Volunteer of the year that particular year, so it was really, really a wonderful experience and that's something that I love to do I can get back to the community, especially to at risk youth? That is an amazing experience 'cause you will always always influence a positive outcome with that.	1
A way that I was probably positively able to influence action of others. I do a lot of food safety training. So I get to work with all of my employees and get them caught up on so then we gotta help district safety practices. And so that's a lot of fun and I get to show them things that they may not know. And things that they don't realize they aren't necessarily supposed to be doing. For instance, cooling temperatures is really important. For Food Safety and so being able to show them hands on working next to them side by side in the kitchen. And showing them how quickly you can cool things come from properly do that, and then be able to help them train. Others to do that.	1
Being in the theater beverage industry and especially in the gaming Associated Gaming Association. We had many large events at Derby Lane. I was able to be a team leader in helping get everyone organized. And up for the task then we would have over 5000 customers show up for our event. OK.	1
Hi I was able to influence the actions of others when I worked as a term her baby. And I was working with the patient. However, the family was not happy with the care that he was receiving. So I thought that was their best interest for us to allow us to do our job and it was our number one priority. To keep the nation safe. So after talking about going over with the safety and the needs of the page and we were able to convert from that. Leaving them inside the facility was the best action possible. Thank you.	1
A situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others has to be at my current job. I work as a shift manager at CVS currently and recently one of my coworkers came to me and she was really. Not feeling as though she's been doing the best job. She is just recently got hired and I personally have been working for the company. Since I was 16 years old, and she just got hired about 4 months ago that she came to me and she was like Christina. Do you feel like I've been doing a great job? I feel like I haven't been doing the best of God that I could be. And I just feel as if on the upper management doesn't see that and I'm like. Her name is Bri. I was like 3. You've been doing perfectly fine just keep pushing yourself and keep doing the best. I really work together with her and ideally gum got returned to enact her. Everything what does she does not feel so strong at and actually decided to teach her and go through everything with her? To help her. Started to get a little bit more comfortable with the things that she's doing at the job issues assistant comfortable with. And from that point she really, really started doing a lot better study feeling more confident in herself after I sat down with her and really taught her. How to go and do things that she thought that she couldn't really do so I was definitely happy that could influence her actions in. I'll make her better. Team member in worker there, so the point is she's come from what she's doing is she feels as though she's appreciated. So I definitely loved that, I could be able to do that for her.	1
And I have been in this situation multiple times where I can or have been in this situation, too positive. Positively influence the actions of others and for example, and I work in an optical currently and so whenever people come in. And some patients can be irritable and you know they just want to get in and out the door. They don't want to wait. And so I I can always feel that when they come in so one thing that I always try to do. Ann is just make conversation after holiday news as soon as it's there. All stay ask them how their summers going if they have any vacation. An planned so and whenever you do that with people I've learned that you can just really get them too. You know be on a positive note get them on their good side and make their waiting times a positive time. And not have to you know go through the stress and the hassle of being at the doctor and all the nerves and. You know the inconsistency so that would be a situation that was great.	1
So basically one way that I was able to positively impact. Others would be by employing my employees for my business that I've been. Running for 20 years spent quite a process. Getting to know how to do that, and how to keep people happy and positively working forward towards you know the best interests or business. An and by being a positive bars and later then I think giving them a lot of positive feedback. And that's definitely been one of the most important factors. That I feel like I have been able to create in my business.	1
The. Best experience that I can give is when I started with Disney and I was doing the traditions program. The first day is all about learning the culture of the company as a great opportunity, I enjoyed every moment of it. Ann. Not with them now but the best thing, that I could describe is when everyone at the table had to select. How much is 8 for the group and take part in and be a leader for the exercise all of my PC? All of the people that work at my table who had never met me before that moment selected me. Should be the voice of our group and it was just a great experience. We did a great activity in which we had to. Identify films. And different. Um different attractions around the theme parks that were older and the interns need to be the spokesperson for the group. And we had a great time. We were one of the Top tables in the room, there were about 15. Different tables about 6 people at a table. So we gave it a sense of immediate teamwork camaraderie in the back that without having. Not any of those people before gave me a sense of Pride and. Um. I think there's something that I I really enjoy to do, I'm in in? The fact that the people had the face sensor trust me it was, it was a really great experience I enjoyed it.	1
Hi describe a situation, which we were able to positively influence the action. Actions of others. Well, what comes to mind for me is, I've been teaching yoga for the past couple of years. And every time I step on the mat and teach my class, I feel like I make a huge impact. On them and positively affect them, for that hour, hopefully carry them through the week. So that's for one example, I can think of where I have a positive influence on others. An I also worked as a nurse. Currently, an my patience mean the world to me, so when they're under my care. I do the best I can to be a good advocate for them. Teachers with respect and give them the best care while I'm there.	1

And so we always had an opportunity to make something of a positive impact on you know, not only staff but. His family members extended family members provide that therapeutic experience. That's required an I think it came to actually for me. I just always had any abilities and compassion and understanding in along with some really season grade coworkers and staff. The the after 10 years as high as it could be an we really had a beautiful kinship and. Strong connection to one another and I think when people would come into the emergency urgent care that they felt that. It was genuine it was sincere an we look to go above and beyond, to really make a satisfactory in above satisfactory. Memorable experience, then go to any hospital. I think, but well, we provide was essential variables that are lacking in certain. Customer service, I think there are 2 it and I think we were working on all cylinders and we put people. I had him ourselves in our own personal needs and stay professional and true to the customers because there's. There's no to certain areas with the same, so we have to treat each person each experience unique and just but but with you know, forthcoming positive approach. In critical thinking skills on deck and so I bring a lot of that a lot of great customer service experience. I'm in the table. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time.	1
Hi so I can recall a situation currently at work that. There was a rather. I rate, higher than we were having an issue with my opinion, I. An and instead of protecting the situation and making it bigger than what it was, I suggested that we. Probably fake the situations were left Harvard area of where the operation was happening and 2 that we will not. Into a bigger command thing in our office, setting it was in the computer room and there was something with going out there. Logging on to someones computer when they were. I'm not authorized to be on there at that time, and as you can tell you know that wouldn't too. A lot of heightened emails things and people being rather. I rate in that situation being fearful of their information being compromised. And or other information being lost from them being able to complete on the coordinate system as if they were trying to do. So I believe that that that situation was one that I had to step in and. Oh. Make a situation where? Flammable if you will and to get everybody to replace this isn't working out and keep it simple in safely right.	1
The summer I was able to positively influence the actions of other was when I believe it was a time where. I had went to. Um assign where I went to. My summer camp it was, I volunteered at summer camp and a lot of the camp counselors were there, we had a lot of. A lot of leisure time So what they did was they thought that it was OK to just kind of fool around. And you know, I've tried to influence them that you know this is the perfect. I'm perfect opportunities to get things done. So maybe we would be able to leave earlier. So yeah, and you know at first, they were like you know this is good timing for us, our free time, however, they definitely. I was able to influence them, then you know perfect time to get cleaned up get the part cleaned up so yes. Eventually I was able to influence them into. Going ahead in uh you know cleaning up the park rather than just sitting around.	1
One situation that I remember where I was able to positively influence the actions of others in a previous. Airline position I was on the ground on the ramp and what I would normally do on every flight. That we upload and download is that during the boarding process. I would go up and get gay chat. Um. With the gate checks. I would go if I had the time, too, if there wasn't any ready yet. I would sit up there and wait once we've already done the upload. I would sit there and wait to see if we had any gauge shotgun, a full flight. So, in particular, Orlando flights of course, there's a lot of kids so once once once I had a flight that I actually. I had a bunch of flight, with loaded with with folks in bags are full I would go up. And actually sit there and wait for the gate checks and as they would go as the kids will go buy it. I should give them high fives and give him more little pounds. Uh as I would say just again just just just to give him that and have that with them. For a while, I was doing that for awhile just off the strings were just doing it. Once I was up there. I started to notice that other folks were doing the same as well, where I would actually take I was actually taking place. Shortly after that, and some of the crew that I would work with I see them. I say Hey. They're actually giving pounds in high fives to kids well again just to have that just to have that. The connection that the kids can have the connections to slide to have a safe flight. Some of these things may be scared. Or just wanna get home or they may be flying alone, but again, it's just to have that connection just to just to kind of give that service all the way around, but that was something that. So I found that was catching on and it became a thing where we were we would give kids in a little town. They have them to let them know that you have a safe flight.	1
Hi my answer would be that my job itself. Is a job that is such that I have to influence others and positively influence them? I have to teach my patients that therapy is something that is very important to them. Staying in their home and being safe in their homes. My job is to teach safety in their home and make sure that they can stay there, not end up in a nursing home or another facility. So I have to positively influence him on a daily basis. I have to teach them the importance of their exercise. How to exercise how to say save how to clear their pathways and all those things that influence them daily so? In the long run, I'm going to implement them and I had to teach them that these things are important to keep them huh?	1
Usually bribery in implementing this using other it's all about being T. Martin just kinda helping role model as to how you want them to represent the company. And when is it practice that I enjoy is making sure that every passenger on flight is greeted with a smile? And once I do that, it seems like everybody seems to follow and they see the captain will see that that is. I'm working with will help as well, and we all pretty much just mimic the same type of energy when it's a positive energie makes it the fact that I gave because? Solitaire.	1
A situation, which I was able to publicly positively influence the actions of others. Hum. She has really hard question I would probably say. Honestly, most times when people come asking me for my advice. On personal matters. Might not give you the answer that you want to hear but I'll give you the answer that I think you need. And that you. Really wanted in the beginning. Hum. I'm not denying not encourage you to do your best. Oh, I do that work off and I'm currently working at Starbucks and their people come. Asking for recommendations from beverage is asking for what they should eat an? I think me being like Hey, you should really try this really helps a lot with. Me positively influencing them 'cause I've made their day better. They often come back and repeat the same drink that they got. And we come back in there like thank you so much for your. Honesty and interaction. Wake me on what I should get never thought of trying that but it's really something that's made my day, a lot better.	1
But I'm not able to influence. So we actually versus 1. Right now, I'm working for clearing the airport clicking airport and a lot of times. You know how customer service can be where the customers can get rowdy they can get mad. For reasons that you know, we cannot handle So what I did was I talked to them, I help them. Find a solution to the problem, putting arcoverde reviews really, and we just help them You know. So maybe I'm sorry I'm really nervous. I hope your customer. Gmail. I had suggested we get through the Lane and I hope my coworker calmed down.	1
So somewhere that to influence a change. I influence the cluster changing from one. Is? Quite recently like something is going through it a change up. And. People not used to. Having changed. I think of the instance last few weeks where if you know just come out for us that change a few procedures and people. Client. Live with these procedures that coming in you have to for me, it's remind people of the positivity that we have. As as working together. Highlighting this you know that it's all 1 as a team, not individual. We have to come together to work with each other. And to make not old age is positive, but also for the customers on board. Just for highlighting little things that people seem to forget their daily basis, how likely very lucky to drop that we do. You know. This many opportunities even any kind of company as I'm accounts. I attend and then we get to travel. The benefits things like that, but we didn't take for granted. These kind of things. I think it's nice to remind people of this. And for me the outcome of this, it makes me feel more positive about the aspect of things are changing. Things are changing, but you know. Suck it reasons and obviously you have to. Ride that wave and get a journey and you may think it's make it at the moment but we'll see. Team praise. I have to feel plus it back everything because you can't you can't be negative. If you're negative effects someone around you so you have to try and have that positivity there. And by trying to invent little things to make people feel better about situations. And make I really big it in half.	1
Hi this may not be a big one, but back in high school I was a varsity basketball player for. 3 years sophomore to senior year 2 of those years from junior to senior I was a team captain. We we had a rivalry game against against one of our our competitors in the local area after the game, though things got kind of rowdy you know, and. Me being a team captain I had to be the face fronts is the leader at all times and. You know lead by example so a couple of our players in a couple of their players starting to get rowdy up into the game. After the after the the winning. Ah. But you know me being the leader that I am in leading by example. I'd put my foot down and you know. Make sure that they follow my example instead of getting around with him take another route another route was. Going to the locker room in mind in our business and just enjoying that win, so I feel like you know sometimes. The most power that you have is the power of influence in the power of example and if you're leading a positive example. So should I didn't that situation and people are more prone to follow you, so that's a little example. But It's a It's a long excuse me Sir. A big example when it goes along way.	1
I have a situation at one of my previous jobs. Um. Two of my coworkers were not getting along. They were kinda, it hours about a certain situation. So I was able to use my positive influence. I take composite accident and. Getting them to be able to start back talking so the work environment, it wouldn't be so hostile Internet. Camera became a little hospital little tension. So I was able to talk to them be like, you know. Y'all are betting that we've been working together for. Such and such number of years, so. Well, you know a person you know what to expect it then. Um. So. Yeah, I've been only talked about this value should know them. So we were able to go and grow. From there. So it was a great. Great opportunity for me to be positive and it turned out to to workout and. Be a positive change.	1
The way I was able to positively positively change the actions of others. I was actually on a flight. To Sturgis SD and we were in a extremely bad hell storm. I had 2 children, sitting next to me to actually replying alone. Uhm I am a mother so I felt like I was able to calm the people in front of them. And behind them and the 2 children and make them feel a little bit more comfortable a man also we had someone who is extremely. Angry that was sitting across the aisle from me. That was very livid because there were 2 children on the plane by themselves and they were crying extremely upset. I was able to call him and hopefully influence them to make them have a happier trip. and I was just a passenger at that point so. It made me feel really good.	1
When I was working at the Armory closet as a fashion stylist in Memphis, TN as a fashion style is we have 2 number one of course. So our customers if they you know choose to. But we also have to interact with them in a very positive. An uplifting way to make them feel comfortable coming into our store. We have to tell them about our sales that go on. Occasionally sign them up for my promotional emails and you know just making them feel welcomed invited so one day one of my coworkers was working with me. And the store was extremely hectic and crazy. This was on a weekend so we really doing a lot trying to cater to their customers. Making sure that we didn't forget anything. Making sure that we just help them out with all of their needs. And so at the end of the day at the end of our shift. My coworker came up to me and told me how it was very hard for her to really help keep up. With everything in the store and she was kind of getting a bit frustrated, but he said that she saw how positive I would think towards everyone. And trying to get to everyone you know in a timely manner, and making sure that I wasn't you know. Forgetting peoples need and so she said that that helps her out a whole lot. And it made her want to do better with her work. And so I told her that there have been plenty of moments where you know it wasn't always sure. Ingram is really keep a brave face and make sure that I just did. My job ended it to the best of my abilities. And she said that that really inspired her and help her to do better too.	1
One situation that I remember where I was able to positively influence the actions of others in a previous. Airline position I was on the ground on the ramp and what I would normally do on every flight. That we upload and download is that during the boarding process. I would go up and get gay chat. Um. With the gate checks. I would go if I had the time, too, if there wasn't any ready yet. I would sit up there and wait once we've already done the upload. I would sit there and wait to see if we had any gauge shotgun, a full flight. So, in particular, Orlando flights of course, there's a lot of kids so once once once I had a flight that I actually. I had a bunch of flight, with loaded with with folks in bags are full I would go up. And actually sit there and wait for the gate checks and as they would go as the kids will go buy it. I should give them high fives and give him more little pounds. Uh as I would say just again just just just to give him that and have that with them. For a while, I was doing that for awhile just off the strings were just doing it. Once I was up there. I started to notice that other folks were doing the same as well, where I would actually take I was actually taking place. Shortly after that, and some of the crew that I would work with I see them. I say Hey. They're actually giving pounds in high fives to kids well again just to have that just to have that. The connection that the kids can have the connections to slide to have a safe flight. Some of these things may be scared. Or just wanna get home or they may be flying alone, but again, it's just to have that connection just to just to kind of give that service all the way around, but that was something that. So I found that was catching on and it became a thing where we were we would give kids in a little town. They have them to let them know that you have a safe flight.	1
Yeah, so there was a situation at work on my work in the education industry industry. Currently, where people were complaining about working overtime just because we had a lot of students that need a service. So during that time you know, I just bought a lot of sense of humor, bringing my my positive iti. Cottages linear body know has you know, there's kids out there that need an education that are looking upon us too. Put them in a better place to listen to their issues. So just to put yourself in a position to be negative isn't really something. That we should be doing you signed up for a job and we're doing something to impact the community. So with me, I would like to bring my positive attitude migrate interpersonal skills just making the the atmosphere more upbeat. And not really focusing on the negatives. Yes, we have to work overtime, but we have a good reason to do it. So that was pretty much my situation. The outcome was amazing. People started saying. Hey can you know what you're right? I didn't think of it like that and You have kids on my own so someone was to put them in a position like that I would definitely understand. You know this thing out there and make sure that we're going above and beyond, to focus more on the students. In matching Easter benefits to put them in a better position for them in their family.	1
So it's installation where I will. Able to install someone positively was it was a special mention with my best friend and her boyfriend. She was asking me for advice on what you should do in that situation. They were having a bad relationship and she wasn't happy anymore. And she asked me to define what it was she said. Do an I'm so happy for her because I told her you know if you're not happy in the relationship those things in it. Don't stay in. It just do better for yourself and for your son. You know you have to worry about your son, now an you. I don't know, man, he doing the place where you're not gonna be happy and. And I told her that and she was happy about it, she left him and now she's single, she's living her life. And she's doing better for her and her son. And I was happy because. I'm glad that I can install someone positively. I'm doing something that's gonna affect them, positive Lee as well. You know, and especially coming back that's fine. You know you want to see him happy and you want the best for them. As well as being a fan center new one, yeah, customers in your passengers to be happy. As in getting in the plane at 2 when they're getting off the plane. And at the time where I positively influence someone.	1
One way that I was able to positively influence the actions of others was during my time as a front desk receptionist. Best Western change the hotel was severely severely understaffed our housekeeping through also severely understaffed. It was almost every day that we weren't able that the housekeeping. Wasn't able to get the room turned over in time for check for knew days check in? I was able to positively influence the actions of others by myself taking it upon myself to hop in with the housekeeping and help out. The hotel it was a rather small properties that we were able to work together as a team to get. To get the help keeping for the day done.	1
I just went somewhere causes positively influence action of others would be added middle part, where I work to Cedar Point. I was 18 liter an override gatekeeper with ride that was called and we were doing a power hour, which means we were trying to go as fast as possible. To get as many guys on the ride quickly as possible, in a safe manner. By doing the power we always try to hit. A certain number of intervals sent for each hour and our goal was to get to 60 on Unfortunately. We weren't doing so hot and then. I started the power hour, but my influence was to provide an incentive for our crew to do better. By offering them You know if I if it did well. That would be able to give them a free dinner or whatever. They wanted to eat I was gonna be you know. Provide them with my dinner and you know buy them dinner and hopefully right look at this uhm dispatch intervals quick. And we will get the cash balance between 50 as possible, and once they heard that they were moving a lot quicker. Making sure there is still having you know, making sure Jasper says so but you know moving quicker. Happy that I was going to offer them this you know. Incentive to do well and make sure that things are going well, and through before our power hour and we actually were able to get the highest number of dispatchers for that. Our and our crews very happy or management already happy and the guests are actually overall happy, too because they are moving to the line very quickly. That was something that really stuck with me, making sure people were positive and staying focused on what was going on. At the task at hand.	1
So the question was to describe a situation in which I was able to positively influence the actions of others. First of all a lot of my answers are going to be airline story related 'cause I'm. Been flying for 2014. Hum. So my first thought was. Back at my former airline when we Merged a Airbus Fleet with Boeing Fleet. I was trained on Airbus then I really prefer air brass. But I knew that I had to. Be comfortable working on either aircraft. So as soon as uh. That merger happened between the two work groups that we're applying through those aircraft. A lot of people started bidding trip specifically for the type of airplane. And I did the opposite. Either do not look or if there was a choice between Airbus or Boeing. I selected Boeing on purpose. The first couple of times so I can get familiar with that. And then when I talk to my classmate, so that we're still close and. Other people are falling within told them that that kind of inspired I was told that a couple of felt inspired him I could do it. Mission 2.	1
I was able to positively influence others. Hospital and we had to have a certain goal. But this is not the 1st to do for sure. If you like the same thing and I had decided to come. I love you for that. So we can get more benefits and everything can be done involved anything you can all the things are going. Alt J. And we had been making the ability to return to the way anyway. BC 85 applications under TV. All together and then the same script.	1
A situation where I had to possibly influence. Others was when I was at work in one of my. Coworkers seems to be a bit frustrated and overwhelmed and I help them out by just saying a little. Later, at work and helping them complete their tasks. And just talking to them to see if there was anything that I could help. You know make their day go easier or you know their work experience go easier. Sometimes I know it's hard. You know going through things in your personal life. So I only tried to help out. Others any especially when it comes to my peers in my coworkers. So that is the time where I was able to positively influence. Others by just helping out in any way they may need me. Recognizing that they may need help it only keeping a smile on your face.	1
Only way I was able to. Positively influence other actions at my current job now I am considered. A leader supervisor. For training. So, like this my best way to finally. Set the tone for a new employee a new coworker that's just starting and they trust me enough to train. And show this person? How to Work at the job. And show them the right things, which. They see that in me because that's why they consider me a lier. I feel like. The way I train it really does have a big impact. On the company I'm just because I show people that just care. For people just have love integrity and you will do great just have confidence and I do that when I do train. Show other people, you know how the work should be doing? Which. Also shows the managers, or the higher up. How great and well I'm doing that's why they chose me so much and continue to let me be able to read people. You know when they first come in. For when they first start.	1
The time and situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others is at my previous job. There was a lady who missed her flight and with her missing her flight. I was able to just sit there and be able to seek to understand you know how she was feeling and what was going on and she she wasn't happy about that? Which normally People aren't happy when they missed their flights. She began to grow and raise a little bit and it was just me being able to calm her down, and actually talk to her and paraphrase OK. I see you're feeling this way how about we go about. This route and I'm able to help you with that and with me being able to do that. She took it in a way of you know. Thank you so much for actually bringing me down at this level and actually realizing my pain and what I'm suffering right now, what I'm missing and thank you for just being able to help me and with me being able to do that. She actually took everything I feel like she saw the bigger picture and I missed my flight, but not only did I miss my flight, but I'm sitting here realizing that I'm able to my actions matter and. If I'm going to sit here and raise I'm not going to get what I want so. Thank you for helping me realize that that's not the right route to go.	1
So there have been many times that I positively influence other people when it comes to my actions, but I've realized that. When it comes to my actions to positively influence people I have to kill people with kindness and I realized that. In certain situations where somebody is negatively looking at life or negatively. You know experiencing life. I realize that it's best to kill people with kindness and. I realize that that's the best action when it comes to life in general is to to use the kindness and sweetness of yourself, too. So humble yourself into to better yourself and to me personally, I I've. I've had situations where people have been unruly and and disgruntled. And I realized that when it comes to dealing with anybody who's disgruntled or unruly that's the best situation. In that aspect is to basically you know kill people with kindness and I feel like that's the only time that I've ever seen you know. It actually work is is. When you kill people with kindness. You basically are able to influence the way that they look at you perceive you and to me personally. Such power been able to you know use my actions to influence people.	1

As expensive charging problem where I suggest so I think that we should go from right to left, you can split it up. And that way we can accomplish more. In short periods of time. Ann. A lot of them was like, Yeah, well. Maybe we should get it sounds good. And so that pervasive in that we decided to do. So instead of everybody just going the regular way that we usually do and everybody just going on separate ways. We all work together and every since then, that has been counted the format for when we go when we went into. Operate in the morning, everybody just kind of went together. We both from right to left and that way we knocked out more. And got everybody felt in a more timely manner and timely fashion. So that was one time that I was able to respond.	1

I just told him to keep his head up and be positive and keep a positive attitude and keep. Thank you for your prayers keep things.	1

Nearest snow everywhere and remember, it's just not having a good time, we had some training to do, we're cold we retire we're hungry? But I was able to do was to take that really just awful day and say, Hey, it's snowing outside. It just means we have better like to do our work. It just means that we're able to not sweat as much work. Just take a positive spin on everything. And ultimately image. Myself and the rest is soldiers go alright. We can make the best verse sure it's cold. But that just means we can wear our warm fuzzy coat and the happy with their and it makes it. Easier to conceal yourself while doing certain sort of tactical maneuvers. Uh. This is one of my favorite times. I was in the military doing tech support movements when. That was The main thing that happened was that I had to listen to all of my other soldiers because I was high ranking them them. I had to listen to their grievances and I had to listen to why they were unhappy and I was also. Able to articulate to them. Hey it's going to be fine. I'll get you some cheerleader a compromise was made. Between myself and my shoulders and it was just a better day for everybody.	1
While I was working at my previous job at fizzle lease I made sure to do the positive attitude. Make the customer feel happy and that they are cared for.

I continue the positive energie flow in between each customer and just the positive values.	1
Just recently I'm from Dayton, Oh, and just recently. We had a tornado multiple tornadoes have swept through our.

The victims of the tornado those who have been left without homes and and food and shelter and an. Ultimately, we checked in and were able to help several families. That that it was actually extremely traumatic, but at the same time, the very rewarding for me to be able to help out in that manner.	1
Hi. Thank you for that question. Uhm I was packed with the parts of the positively influenced orders are at my job. Uh when I was working with the post office. I remember it was a time there was a lot of. No and they have a lot of cold out and it was very difficult for everybody or anybody to get there, I just. I love my job and I was able to make it there somehow and make the daily and delivering Mail. Anyone allowed people was inspired by it because it was so difficult for them to get there at work. And I was able to make it. On time and to deliver the Mail. The packages and render the services that the customers are waiting for. In not even my manager. The postmaster was very, very appreciated because I made the day because it's basically no one. I really came to work that day and I was there, it was maybe about how much they show up to work. And I was very excited by it because a lot of people are plugged before my expertise, even his. Work long distance for me to get there, but I'm limited on time and I made it possible and I know I have to provide the service for my customers and to make them happy. Thank you for that question.	1
When a time when I. It was a positive influence on the actions of others and when I was working in for the city of Rancho Cucamonga. As a preschool in structure. I was the face of the classroom. So the first thing the parents of the children would see. Um. I was the first, the first one, said to be there, I was the head of the class. So it's very important to be positive and have a positive actions and. Because I My actions would trickle down to the children and parents. And so I remember in the middle of the year 1 teacher she. She got another job somewhere else and I had to step in. And. For that class in the middle of the year and it was very hard at first too. To get these these parents on these children to get used to me. And so I would just be positive and everything an also I had to be positive for my my. My assistant teacher. So she was relying on me as well, an eventually we all we all. Got to know each other and the parents were very comfortable with me in the end and the kids loved me. So I feel like it's very important to. To be positive and You know in everything that you do in life. It's Very important to know that your actions affect other people. Ann. Positive iti is always the key.	1
A situation where I was able to parse the path positively influence. The actions of others would be when I was working at their Four Seasons at the smoothie bar. A lot of people ask me for advice what they would choose for ingredients in their smoothies. For health benefits or for healing benefits. And I was able to suggest recipes that would help meet their needs and that was a very positive experience for them. As well as remembering their recipes from year to year when they would return. And I really feel like that created a great relationship moving forward between the guests and I. And I really enjoyed that aspect of the job.	1
A time where I was able to actually influence. Others is something I found myself in a position like. I often I love to always be positive and be that one person that change the environment in the culture in the room. You find yourself a lot in a situation where it is one I got a person can affect a lot of other people. But it happens, the same way if you are applying the person you can effect. A situation recently I had a delay 3, articulate and people were bummed out. We were on the plane for about 2 hours and. We have told the other viruses. It was Hey. We have to get these people in a better mood. So let's go ahead and do a service service let's. Create conversation and just have these people uplifted understand that we're here for them and we understand what they're going through and she was pretty bummed out the entire didn't care to really participate, I said, Hey. This is our job and we have to do it and she kind of got on board and she ended up. Talking for a couple that was pretty funny and kept her up with it and she thanked me then how I was. So happy that you, you know just kept positive things contact list of all upon be an any situation where I can find myself to. Always just make somebody feel better. The situation an if you ever realize that if you're that one happy person all the time. Printer invincible around you.	1
It would be at my current job that I am working at. I am the patron came in and was. Upset at the situation that had happened with another employee of mine at my job and she wanted to speak with the director. Does she wasn't available at the time so I asked her if she wanted to write down on what the? Situation that has happened. And see if I can get it to her. The directory right away so her problem could be resolved. She really appreciated the fact that I took the time and. Hand delivered the letter that she wrote to the director and she was really happy. When I'm happy but she was. Very. Grateful. At the fact that I was able to help her and call her anger down just a bit when she was visibly upset.	1
A situation where I. Positively. Affected others what comes to mind for me was when I was a teacher a special Ed Teacher, Hawaii. Went on a Field Trip with my students and it was just my other team partner an eye on the bus. With a deaf students and while we were on the bus. I noticed that the back of the bus. I'm trying to look foggy so I went and walked in the back of the bus and I noticed there was a little more smoke than they probably should have been. Try very calmly went up to the bus driver, before even telling my partner and I said, I really think we should. Pull over to the side. I see a lot of smoke and I'm concerned for my students so right away. The bus driver did that an and called in nine one. One just in case and I went back to my partner. And I said, We need to be very calm and let's get our children off this bus quickly tell him that. The Bass Pro, it's it's OK. It'll be alright. So I was able to get them off without quickly and it was a good thing because there was a small fire. They had started underneath underneath the car or the the box excuse me so I was so happy that I was. People too. Kind of take care of that situation, which was very stressful quickly and in a positive way so that my students were safe. And we got back to this folder principles had all the classes come out into the hallway and clap for us so. It was awesome.	1
So naturally I am a very. Happy person and so positive iti for me comes a little easier if you like. Than it does for others so I bring that into the workplace everywhere. I go and there was a time where. I used to work at a Panera and everything was going wrong, but you know the lights weren't working, you know. Computers were all backed up and it was. Very very frustrating, even for me and I'm a very happy person and so you know, I was just. It was my my managers told me it was my attitude and my positive outlook on it that was. Kept everybody going uh you know just really set the mood for everybody and we ended up getting through this one of our best sale days. And that is really spoke to me like you know. Attitudes matter and if you don't have. A positive outlook on life like I don't feel like people really understand exactly how much. Eh. Good attitude can have on the entire workplace so I would say that would be an example that I used. That I was able to positively change. People.	1
So basically one way that I was able to positively impact. Others would be by employing my employees for my business that I've been. Running for 20 years spent quite a process. Getting to know how to do that, and how to keep people happy and positively working forward towards you know the best interests or business. An and by being a positive bars and later then I think giving them a lot of positive feedback. And that's definitely been one of the most important factors. That I feel like I have been able to create in my business.	1
In my current work please. I have been able to positively influence the actions of others. By helping our volunteers that come out. I work on an ambulance. So we have volunteers that come out in our learning. And I'm able to help them by. Showing them people skills and showing them how to always be nice to a patient or patient's family. They're going through a really rough time because they're not used to being on an ambulance and it's a really scary time for them. So showing my volunteers that they need to always think about the family and the patient. And that they are not used to this situation. Is a great way? I influenced by volunteers and then they're able to take that out on the road with them. When they go and have their own calls. And they can use that on the road and I think it's just a great way to positively influence them. Because you can never be too nice in those types of situations.	1
So I positively influenced others. It was winter than it was the delayed flight hold course. We had some people that weren't very happy with the situation. I was up front, so I was in charge of all pays and making sure that everybody is comfortable. And created them when I come on the plane so when you come on the plane when you have a smile on your face. It's kind of helpful. 2. See someone that is happy and excited to have you on the flight even though you know you're going to be running behind so? What we did is we had everybody sit down we told him? How long delays going to be that we knew of. And make sure we hit up snack. I make sure the TV for on so that they had entertainment while we were sitting. I checked on everyone throughout the flight. I kind of kept up the rest of the crew because we knew we were going in for a long flight it was a 4 hour flight. On Top of it, so we won't be getting until really late. But I mean, sure everybody was real peppy and excited. And by the time we landed we had turned everybody's fine upside down. And they were excited to get off the plane. and I think that's an an were very gracious for the fact that. They kind of didn't notice how long the delay was in the end.	1
One time I was working in a dialysis facility. And I had a patient that was very nervous an wouldn't know what to do. In at the time being, there was another patient that's been doing dialysis for a long time. He came to me and approaching and said, would you mind if I talk to their patients so I could let them know that everything was going to be OK? So he took like a brief minute talk to the patient competition down in the patient was able to get barrel assists. For me, I think that was very interesting and very cringing and I was very happy about that situation.	1
As an opportunity on several occasions to do a lot of volunteering. One of my funnest time that ever had volunteering was at an organization called Prodeo. It works with high school students who are. A little bit misplaced. And so forth so we do a lot of different types of activities outside of the the home or. That we do it in that way we get to go out and being influenced them so that we can teach them. Things in the world world like doing accounting processes. Or maybe exploring new places going to museums and things like that, and it's just been one of the most gratifying things that I've ever done being able to influence. So many young children.	1
A situation where I had to positively influence the actions of others occured when. There were 4 of us working together. When I was this server. And then the integration we all retired and we all wanted to go home. There were several of us in only a certain amount could get into the cabin. Being a team player I know that it's important, not to leave anybody behind the situation was we were all ready to go home. But this cab driver could only set a certain amount of people in the taxi. I influenced my team to realize we don't leave anyone behind. We call another taxi how we all need together, we only together on your only so the situation was, I was able. Say influence my coworkers to know that we stick together as a team. Always. And the end result was out and able to positively influence their decision. We did stick together as a team. They all left together.	1
A situation that I was able to. Help others was I work at a Community College so I'm always, in her students or which classes they should pay. And uh. How much they cost and I do as soon as that? Don't have as much money as a regular curriculum student would so I kind of try to hear them. Is it taking a class that will get them quicker job then maybe trying to get a college degree?	1
Hum situation an where I am which I was able to positively influence the actions of my coworkers and. From while working at Amazon. We have different items is that we have to reach and I came up with a smart ways. For us to interact with our customers that are not tech savvy so just letting my fears know that. Having more patience and also making sure we go in debt with explaining to make the process easier for our customers that one text Abby. Um what that did was increase ourselves and allow people that weren't textile these are not being hindered or. Hum. We've heard from buying any of the new product.	1
Recently, my daughter never traveling and we got to the airport quite early and there was an older lady. I don't know maybe my I'm sitting on the floor. Crying pretty distraught. So we approached her intent, ma'am, what's going on? Can we help you? And her mother in law had died the day before, and she was headed to the serial but she had gotten. Share a Phone number, but somehow she maybe it was great, it overcome her, but she got really confused about where to go and what to do. So we have there. Get back to her husband, who rather take her to the gate right away. But she didn't have her boarding pass. So we took her. We helped her get to where her husband was and then we heard from both get through security get all the way to their gate. To make sure that they made it on their place? So it's not really good to know that we help them deal with really. Difficult situation in a way that they got their family back connected in together for A. For a start time and help you refuse some confusion disorientation whenever she was going through that made it difficult for her so. It was really satisfying to get her all the way through her gate. I mean, we were in an employee with airline. At the time of course, and so. Still I just kind of built into my character to do that, so thanks.	1
Try OK this is an easy one, I've been a fitness instructor for 37 years and every single thing I do. Is washed very carefully? I am in charge of leading people through exercise very safely very effectively and with funds. It has pretty fun or people won't come back. And I have been very successful at that for a long time, and that has allowed other people too. No improve their health and Wellness, but also have a sense of camaraderie has something to look forward too. Sometimes they're exercise classes for racial part of their day. I've always taken a lot of joy in doing that and so positively influencing other people have been part of my lifestyle. 37 years and counting.	1
I was able to positively influence others. Hospital and we had to have a certain goal. But this is not the 1st to do for sure. If you like the same thing and I had decided to come. I love you for that. So we can get more benefits and everything can be done involved anything you can all the things are going. Alt J. And we had been making the ability to return to the way anyway. BC 85 applications under TV. All together and then the same script.	1
Anytime I employed someone is in a positive manner that I'm sending positive tone and that I. Really, thinking positive messages across. For a situation in which? I positively influence people's actions. Was? My freshman year of college had a small Catholic University. Going with small Catholic University, there's not much diversity. Bye I took that infest types. It seems to me to be able to teach people who may not have experience. Black gay man before. So is able to. Chico spot, which become actions that people may have. And. Allow them to know that asking questions OK. Learning is OK. That when you want to learn about somebody says the best positive thing you can do because it breaks down. Boundaries. And opens up doors of conversation allow people to circulate comfortable with one another. So the situation being. Survivors. The action rifle was opening up disappearance in creating a gay club on encountered Reversi approved. For the first time. And I've been allowed students coming out. Health tap Catholicism in religion intertwined with. Homosexuality. And really start getting the conversation diversity moving on Camera.	1
After manager at 24 hour fitness. I feel like it's my job and responsibility to motivate and inspire my team. And so recently I got a promotion into a new manager position at a location in Buena Park CA. With this promotion, I had a whole brand new stuff that I had never met before and there's one girl. Father, who had recently started the week before I got my promotion and within this time, I've been able to. Encourage and inspire her and she actually decided that she wants to take a step further with 24 hour fitness. And she's recently increased her goals each month when it comes to our member acquisition and our member retention. In order to get promoted herself within the company. This is an accomplishment. I feel like I've made by being able to. Inspire and motivate my team to move in the right direction with our company.	1
A time where I was actually able to influence others. I worked an English Department chair as English Department chair I was able to work. With all English teachers, not only at my location, but also at 4 other schools. When I was able to do, we had to, I was responsible to? Manage a lot of the events for our teachers as well as our students. So one thing I was able to do is during the meetings I would also. Listen to everyone's input and then from there, I would do an amalgamation of what everybody says, and then create an event from there. The result of the action was really great because I had a lot more inquiry. and I had a lot more investment into the program because I actually listen to what everyone had to say. Which was really helpful for me because when you're in English Department he ran with your English teacher you want to make sure that you're speaking and listening to. I mean, the visuals that actually are incorporated or involved in the Department and then also you're able to take it inquiry of. And the students and what their interests are as well. So unable to influence everyone by being able to create a program that everybody was interested in. It was not that great because the tours of the students went out the investment of the teachers went up. And overall I enjoyed it very much.	1
So this is the way she that I can think about right away. It's when I was at a waiter. And in a uncle Julio's restaurant. I was told that every time we see a kid with for example, an A dizzy but I mean. Not disease like with them, which is who is gluten free. We have to make sure that everything will be prepared for him. Without using any glow dance and so I have this customers whose parents advised me that his kids I was like 10 years old. He was gluten free. Alright so to make sure I I given the best service that they could get and they couldn't possibly have. I went to my manager I double check with him, which dishes on the menu on the card or to Toledo. Gluten free and then I can safely serve to him and so the manager came back with me to the table. Um. Is he or she was talking to her at parents an and? Letting them know which position are very safe for her for their kids and this way. I saw my other colleagues. Coming to me and they were like well coming up next time we gonna do exactly the same thing because. There's always a fear in that then we gotta we gonna recommend the the wrong item for for the kids. Or for the person who is gluten free so they were just very thankful that I did this 1st. And I was not afraid to ask for help from the manager just to ensure that our customers are getting 100%. Save options for the skin.	1
Well, I've situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others occured actually while I was on. A flight it was an early morning flight from Denver to um. We were going to Washington DC. I cannot remember if it was. Dulles or Reagan, but we were it was an early morning flight and. The situation was that the we were DI thing and the DI think spray unlatched the window. Where one of the one of our passengers were seated and so the deicing fluid started coming into the plane. Luckily, there was a pilot seated next to her. Install the entire thing, he Rang his Bell and the problem was that this lady was so afraid she said that. One of her relatives had been on the Southwest wide where someone with window. The Lady got the window. Depressurizing the Lady got sucked out and so she was very afraid so the lady. She was crying she was very upset. And she had been bring she was in the exit row, but we ended up going with calmed her down. And we got her relocated to the 2nd row because she had paid for an upgrade and once we realized that she was not. A suitable candidate for the exit row even though she had. Agreed to be in the end isn't red she. We got her move to the 2nd row and calmed her down. And he was able, we actually ended up changing planes and she was actually able to fly comfortably and we just. Checked on her periodically and make sure that she was happy.	1
OK. Service adjusting the Camera so time, then I'll be able to positively influence actions others with me when I was working at Starbucks. As I'm sure you can imagine at Starbucks we would get different drink. Orders have variety of modifications on them and there's a brief that's your job. Did they can seriously in order to make sure that the customer gets the car drivers that every morning? And that may be happy, So what time is drink water came in. I believe this lady had a call. Look professional but I had like. Choose stickers worth modifications on him and one other bracelet for complaining about the Cup, and that angered breathe. I didn't have any problems like. Just link up in trying each time to make it took me a total of 3 trying to make the drink. And on the 3rd time I was able to practical way that the Lady had desired it. So then it should have shown time should want me to make her drink but then. Over the course of time when I was reading is hard because we both show other baristas how to make her drink and like. Flights important to make company tracks the way that pages are done. Just 'cause they are paying for quality drink and you want to make sure you're providing quality service. So showing and demonstrating my. Seriousness or my Sicilian taking customer service and the quality of our product that we produced I was able to influence. And coming in training. Bri says about beverages and show them that there is the right way to do things and that there's a Starbucks procedure for our reason. And that's why it came up with the trainer at Starbucks and that's why I was able to coach includes other. Creases and develop my partner development plan. Thank you.	1
So I currently own a hot yoga studio and we get customers in every day that we serve and sometimes miscommunications can occur. And people will be upset. We've had an unhappy customer come in lately and right away and I just listened. Instead of becoming defensive I just listen to the situation and slowly communicated gently starting with an apology and once I help set the tone the conversation from their completely turned around the customer. Realized it was just miscommunication and we were able to not only continue to work that solution, but we are also able to continue to talk thereafter. Dinner.	1
First of all I was trying to think of a situation of several situations that I've been in that uh. Influence others basically in 2017 my mom's home was flooded for doing this storm, Harvey Storm. And actually we most of the folks in the neighborhood were senior citizens and so when the flood actually happened. Before the water came up, I sprung into action actually was able to go to each neighbors house knock on the door. With zip lock bags and I was able to contact all the other neighbors neighbors in my mom's neighborhood. And asked him to get zip lock bags for the senior citizens in the neighborhood to pray for all their medications. An any type of important paperwork like their insurance cards to come to zip them up in a zip lock bag. Before the water rushed into their homes, so that was a big that was a big I guess spur the moment, thinking I should say. And then I was able to influence the other neighbors to get involved with zip lock bags going from door to door to each senior citizens home. And we were able to do that in in a very, very productive way.	1
The situation where I'd be able to positively influence the action. Others words at work Monday where the morale amongst. All the staff members were very well. Sharing up in library hurts so I actually went out and bought some Jacobson balloons and just had a second time. So everybody could be more energetic happy and just be able to go through the day better and made it. Big impact on employment. Prodigy influencing my employees.	1
Most recently I had a situation at work, where one of my coworkers wasn't getting along with one of my managers. And the best thing, that I could do in my position, which was what I did was to take him aside and just kind of telling this ticket. And now we are at work for many reasons and that once we get through our shift we can go home. And it's no big deal, we can come back tomorrow with a fresh basil. Fresh ideas fresh mindset and not worry about the things that happened, the previous. We don't know what our manager was going through or what made her date not the best in me. The reaction that she had to a situation not the best so I think it's always hard to get somebody. The benefit of it now and it just shake it off and drive new day and you took that advice. We had a fantastic shift and now we go back to work later this week and hopefully the lab refresh rate that.	1
OK, so my background is in the customer service financial industry, I was. Going into work not too long ago and I recalled seeing over 200 calls in 2, which is. Pretty substantial because we typically when I walk in. It's about 10 or 1110 to 20. I'm sorry calls in queue so. To see it grow that much, wood pretty you know. Alarming. Once I got in and then there are typically come in about 15 or 20 minutes early to work I was able to help. Get the calls down in 30 minutes down to 100, so I was able to break it down. Hum. In half a day for my coworkers on my team and then once I seen that everyone was still. Pretty much anything I. Was able to allow allow people to take breaks into this room that I created a yoga room for? Um people kind of calm down and be able to.	1
Hi my name is Dennis when Archie describe a situation in which you were able to positively influence the actions of others. Hum. There was a situation at work. To where we were using a lot of copy paper, a lot of copy paper a lot and my. Company was big on recycling, but they're trying to find the cost of overhead was ridiculous, um positively influence them. To instead give everybody an email an instead of printing out, everything we would just send emails everybody and. I think they positively change course of us not spending so much money on the overhead an instead of.

And one day he broke something and she was so afraid to document until like our manager because she didn't. She want to get into any trouble and I told her that it was the right thing to do. Um and you shouldn't get in any trouble you're honest and worst case scenario, you have to pay for it. The item that you broke and so with a little bit of encouragement, she ultimately did the right thing. The result was really just. OK, no big deal just by the report of what happened and sleep up to miss to make sure no one gets hurt. An ultimately turned out just fine.	1

Hi Yes, working at. Dover downs, ultimately sometimes routinely at events. Most people get tired and they try to get down, and they start to think, though, we can just. Just slow down and they get tired but when I try to do is show them how much we've already. Accomplish as a team and I tried to encourage them to continue to work harder until the job is completely finished. I do give them like little things as far as like. Maybe some encouragement as far as. Treats or just you know little things. Here in there with most of my coworkers and I trying those enough looking conversations, and smiling and cracking little girls in there. When there is time. Hum. Ultimately, I think showing what we've already accomplished as a team and giving them things and telling them that they're doing a great job influences their behavior in there. To continue to work hard and. Get the job done.	1
Hello I would say a time where I was probably acted would be when I was serving. And some pizza at the time we had a coworker that came in and decided to leave and just didn't sound didn't tell anybody anything. With a busy night with a Fright Fright Night League with Mayweather and. Thank you. I believe there was a really big, big night.

First situation that comes to mind is when I was working at Tijuana Flats and I don't mean that I'm down. But you know, there's more open till variety of people that they hire with not as many qualifications so. Being that as it may I remember there's a situation where. It was a short as I forget exactly what it was, but there was definitely the shortage of a specific ingredient or a specific type of food that we were serving. And. Instead of going to the back and just refilling seeing something simple instead of going in. Getting a preparing and bring it to the front and then creating things right with creating the food exactly the right way. There were other people in the mind that were just put a different ingredient, not being that may sound like a small thing but. More of the you know as a customer. You you want you or something like that. You want to get. What I what I did ask it was like I said simple right just wanted to back again prepared and I brought it to. The other workers of attention that Hey, you know if we are. Keep working with the team working professionally and you know this is the place that pays as we should do things right. And I kind of had that small conversation with him and just kind of help them realize it's like Hey. Given. What you want to receive not to give us rocky will respect you have to give it as well? It's just. Basically, I was just able to go ahead and. Let them know him and realized that quality matters, no matter what, if you want to have something with your own later on.

Effort to positively influence a group of high school girls uhm. I don't know if I see exact answer. You want to hear but uhm, yeah, so being a coach you're constantly everyday day in and day out. You know, having to try an put this energy into these players and um. Really? You have to know how to speak to a group of girls and no there. Um character traits and know how you can speak to one girl. How you can't speak to the other. Um. And it's really. You know how I think teacher you know students responds to teachers who are passionate about what they do, and that kind of goes with coaching as well so. I found that when I showed up. Positive and ready to go and I couldn't manage you and I put in the effort and I was prepared. They responded you know, an so when I coached it was a daily. Effort to try to be a positive influence and then successful seasons. I think I did pretty well it.

Ended up talking the rest of the state that they were there and it just teamwork is is it really goes along way. So. That's I would say teamwork and just keeping positive attitude really helps in any situation.	1
Uh there was a situation where I work with one of the people that we took care of with. Actually. Having a behavior and nobody would step in to help. I stepped in and helped the situation by talking to the individuals holding them down. Out of the situation. And we were able to get them stable and keep everybody safe. An you know along with our day.	1
There was a situation and work where a number of people were complaining about another employee a colleague of ours. And. They were not really speaking behind most highly of this person not giving the person the opportunity to answer questions explain themselves. Somehow, I was able to what I was able to do, and my task was to make everyone. Get the try to get along So what I did is I said everybody is that everyone down. I said, This is really not. Fair that other person is not in the room and everyone is talking attacking this person. So what I did ask is we bring the person in. We sit down with them and we discussed the situation. Once the person was able to answer questions explain what the problem that they were having was. Everyone came to an understanding and the whole situation was defused. Everyone was happy again and we had a better time. At work.	1
Well, I've situation where I was able to positively influence the actions of others occured actually while I was on. A flight it was an early morning flight from Denver to um. We were going to Washington DC. I cannot remember if it was. Dulles or Reagan, but we were it was an early morning flight and. The situation was that the we were DI thing and the DI think spray unlatched the window. Where one of the one of our passengers were seated and so the deicing fluid started coming into the plane. Luckily, there was a pilot seated next to her. Install the entire thing, he Rang his Bell and the problem was that this lady was so afraid she said that. One of her relatives had been on the Southwest wide where someone with window. The Lady got the window. Depressurizing the Lady got sucked out and so she was very afraid so the lady. She was crying she was very upset. And she had been bring she was in the exit row, but we ended up going with calmed her down. And we got her relocated to the 2nd row because she had paid for an upgrade and once we realized that she was not. A suitable candidate for the exit row even though she had. Agreed to be in the end isn't red she. We got her move to the 2nd row and calmed her down. And he was able, we actually ended up changing planes and she was actually able to fly comfortably and we just. Checked on her periodically and make sure that she was happy.	1
I'm being a server so we get a lot. A lot of gas who are from other countries and they aren't accustomed to the traditions in America and so. On my location in particular that is majority of our clientele. And so a lot of the Times. They don't know that tipping is something that they do. In America and Even so, if they do they don't always prefer to do it, so I recently had a? New server who was actually working with me in my same room and she had a party that was a huge deal. Is about $300 and they left her $10.00 so she was very upset and she just felt like she gave them the utmost service and she didn't know where she went wrong. Even with them being a little rude to her. She still remain calm and continue to smile and so I've seen that. Just kind of got her down the rest of the day she didn't really want to have that positive attitude that she started off with with her other table so. I gotta just put her aside. Nasser was going on. That's when she let me know. and I simply just said to her listen. We've all been through it. If I'm gonna be honest with you, it's gonna happen again, but will you have to remember is the tables that you have now you cannot hold them accountable for what the other has been 'cause they have nothing to do with that. And if you have that energy they're going to realize that they're going to feed off of it and then you can continue to not make any money because they don't want it because they didn't like your attitude so. She colleges understood where I was coming from and she was like you know what you're completely right because at this point in time now. I'm not giving them. Another attitude and I said listen I've been doing this for a little while. I'm here do you guys happen again? You win some you lose some but you gotta keep going and just so that you did your best. You did your job and what you want to do so.	1
First of all I was trying to think of a situation of several situations that I've been in that uh. Influence others basically in 2017 my mom's home was flooded for doing this storm, Harvey Storm. And actually we most of the folks in the neighborhood were senior citizens and so when the flood actually happened. Before the water came up, I sprung into action actually was able to go to each neighbors house knock on the door. With zip lock bags and I was able to contact all the other neighbors neighbors in my mom's neighborhood. And asked him to get zip lock bags for the senior citizens in the neighborhood to pray for all their medications. An any type of important paperwork like their insurance cards to come to zip them up in a zip lock bag. Before the water rushed into their homes, so that was a big that was a big I guess spur the moment, thinking I should say. And then I was able to influence the other neighbors to get involved with zip lock bags going from door to door to each senior citizens home. And we were able to do that in in a very, very productive way.	1
Alright hello so it I'm in a situation where I was able to influence positively the actions of others.

We kind of continued this tradition of making this big bouquet of balloons and. Kind of getting different get together, the kind of celebrate their birthday and just make them feel special so I feel like that was a very. Positive impact at my job.	1

But definitely have to be working in the restaurant and we were. 10 minutes from closing and we had a party at 15 walkthrough door an pretty much all of our side work was done. Everybody was ready to go home. But of course, this customer is always come first, and we have to accommodate every customer that walks through the door. So instead of. One person taking the party. We had 3 people attack with the parties so that everybody could get garden timely matter, we can get their food. In their drinks delivered in a timely matter, and then everybody could go home in a timely matter, so we worked as a team. To get the task done an instead of? You know. Instead of Being upset and you know. Having away. Maybe like 30 minutes after closing times. We were able to accommodate everyone and timely matter, an everybody was. Happy. Man.	1

So one of my jobs that I had before it was as a substitute teacher for the Orange County Public Schools. Distance and one of the things that we were required to do even at substitutes was whenever there was. A fire drill we all participated. So I was working in a fifth grade classroom an I had a young man who is. I created a day trip to change and say how he wants he was acting really out of control. She's very nervous because the fire alarm had just gone off and he was nervous about that and So what? I tried to do in a situation where where people are nervous or scared or there's a crisis situation. It's just keep people calm and so these kids didn't know if it was a fire drill or not they just knew that the. Alarm had gone off So what I did was immediately changed my tone of talking very loudly to quieting my voice down. I'm just trying to hope that they would mirror that and so as we were all getting together. I lined them up and I actually put the young man. 2 things so wild and out of control in charge of a thing to do So what I did was made him. In charge of making sure that the line was saying type constraints, but he stood in the back of the line. And nature to Holler at the trends if they were you know, getting out of line member states height. History and so I feel that one way that I was able to positively impact those kids, and hidden Ticular was. Showing that you know when you're nervous and when you're excited Anna situation, it's always best to stay calm. And I feel that my actions of staying calm here, putting him in charge of the task showed the other kids. In a positive way how to handle a situation like that. And so we were able to get out in the time that we needed to. And our class was where they needed to be and we went back inside for the rest of the afternoon.	1
There in 2014 I worked as a logistic specialist. And I happen to work with coworkers ahead. Language barrier. And they're usually be. It was a lot of tension between the 2. And I live. Be acting manager at the time and I had a sit down with both. Correct. And I try to. Have both seen. The different perspectives. On the situation that happened and. Took awhile. On the same page. Eventually, they came. So 1. Conclusion. And we had sensing sessions, after. As well to see what else we can do to improve in this slide and I think that was. A great rain. Amongst the workplace because. Workplace tension. Good environment to be in in it impedes progress.	1
He time I was able to positively influence others with when I was working at Wells Fargo I took. The responsibility being a teller to help out the managers setting up. I'm on it question scheduling, so once you set in and want to help it makes others want to step in and also help. So, just stepping up and being a leader also helps other people step up India leader.	1
Where was able to partially influence the actions of others in my current job? I work for the guys group? Which is the energycap campaign. And basically I have no that my presence actually improves is the people in the room. So I make it a point to like when I come in. I say Good morning, says Hi smiled everyone. Now so I bring down to 7, one and I could really boost morale in the office. A lot of times if I come in like sad or upset that definitely influences the office so. It's just the Energi that I try to pay attention to is not only with that job. I think with any job going in with the power of Outlook and being happy. And knowing that you are your presence is appreciated and wanted as well as other people's presence is appreciated. But it definitely probably effects like how they want to work at the job so that's how I possibly affect the influence the actions of others because. It really does help them around at the end of the day and everybody's numbers go up so. That's what I did I did it ask.	1

A situation in which I was able to positively influence the actions of others. Occured in my previous position, I was doing a americorp program in which I was doing completing 1700. Hours of community based service and I would located at the Berkeley High School Health Center. In this position I would do 1 on one health education appointment with high schoolers. A lot of it involved doing education and motivational interviewing around reproductive and sexual health. So I can remember one instance in particular, where a student. Um disclosing information to mean in which? She was struggling with her own health, she was struggling with her own reproductive sexual health. And I was able to give her the advice that she needed. And. I was able to different education on how to be healthy and how to be safe. And she was very receptive to it, and it was really a good experience for me because. I got to see how. I was able to influence her and how she was so receptive to everything I was telling her. That I knew that her behavior was going to change and that she was going to take what I had given her. And actually roll with it and actually implement it in her life. And she thanked me so much afterwards, she was so thankful and I think that's what really hit home is how think well high schooler was. After coming into a health clinic and how excited and happy, she was when she left and. That's how I knew I had a really positive impact that day.	1
I like to consider myself as a leader so a situation where I was able to pass it possibly. Influence the actions of others comes to me a lot. The first thing that popped into my mind to do a lot of work in the community in Philadelphia. Area. Uh with my organization, so we do a lot of events for the homeless population. I go around I. Raise donations for toiletries for clothes or shoes. Um. And we go out to the community and we deliver these bags, so it with. Toiletries T shirt socks everything that they need we deliver food. And we just have good conversation and it's very positive environment another situation. I am currently director at a day care if I do a lot of work with the use. And we took the kids over to the community park. I really the only. Day care center in the park at the time picking up trash, so we had a community service day. And we had other children in the park who we didn't even know Joyner so I'm I'm big on leadership. I'm big on positive iti inspiring others being a positive influence to everybody around.	1
I can think of many instances where it had this opportunity on the job. But my most recent experience I would say. Is the training 6 weeks training 6 weeks of training that I had and positively influence my classmates by? Dedication by my positive attitude and just to respect that I gained from my fellow classmates because of the respect that. Skype for me and I was able to portray for them. And this very grateful to have that impact on them and. I can think of opportunities that I've had this informer positions that I've had as well. I'm just somebody known to go above and Beyond and I think that that. Is something that? Influences others to do the same definitely to be genuine and for them to be able to recognize that. Inspires them to do the same.	1
As a Postal manager there was a lot of situations where customers had problems. And the delivery of their Mail so. It was my task to make sure that both the customer. Any employee. Understood. The. Relevance of how they both interact in both the customer service and the employee had there be in alignment. And work together the best situation for this that I can think of is there was a customer where they are. Express Mail arrive the day late. It was obviously our fault, he was very. Upset about it keep him into the office to speak to me personally. I assured him that. We were. We were doing the best we could to get that to him in a timely manner, which he was upset because he needed it. Overnight and it took 2 days and then I explain to him, the situation that happened where the delay was. And so I kinda. Given given must analysis of horrors system's work. An once he realized that it wasn't our fault. And I went ahead and gave him a refund. He left very assured. And comfortable that we were doing the best we could. And so. Number one was to keep the customer happy and #2 was to work as a team with the rest of our. Voice.	1
So I didn't bring my last job, then I was cashier and my my my manager. He was he was super busy. And then like he was he was doing something else but I customer was waiting to talk with him. And then on my other collecting stars, but I think that you can try to talk with him and then. See what's going on and then maybe maybe you can try help nothing I think I think I can do that. I'm going to try. And then I I went back to the customer and I was. I say so like he's a little busy right now? Is there anyway that I can help you. And then you go no like I just I just want that once you ask him, he are you guys hiring because. I really want to work in the company and blah blah blah and then I was thinking. I. Like I was super hand because I helped him and then my other friends. They served I know you can do it just. Just go there and talk to him and then I was like I said, I was happy because I was. Able to help him.	1
I have to say with my most previous job, I was in charge of coming up with the monthly and weekly. Freezer door closed just to encourage other agents on the floor. You know to be encouraged into you know keep pressing. And still I believe that just being in that position is enabled me to positively given that push or. The simple words to you know push them to keep going on and so I was very proud of that and I became very influential. In that you know position to the point where aside from that, we would just come together to have a small group such as smallpox. Every at the end of every week and so yes, except my most influential. Reflect that I have. My previous employer.	1
Well, there was a situation while working on a normal healthy and it as a nurse. Where there was a patient who had just come on to the unit and she was? Not there by choice, she came in kicking and screaming and she was. Clearly very scared to be there and. A lot of my coworkers responded to the situation with exasperation 'cause that is something that we see quite often on the mental health unit people that. After in such ways, but I tried my best to treat the patient as an individual, not just another one patient who acted that way. An I you know talked to her in a calming manner, an I told her that she is safe. And I've tried to do everything I could to make her comfortable even when she was screaming at me, I got her extra pillows. I got her water. And I got her situated into a room, which is not common practice usually we doing assessment in it. Medical examination room, impatient there admitted but I knew that would make her even more uncomfortable so I took her straight to her room. And it actually did work out very well after I got on her level. I don't try and talk to her in that calming and therapeutic manner, she was able to come down. Without the use of medication, which my Co workers were preparing to give her I always think that it's good, too. Tell you help people without medication 'cause it doesn't really. Get to the root of the issue. It's much better to just talk to them and try to resolve the situation in that manner so. I was able to positively influence that patient stay on the unit.	1
At the leader I've had many opportunities to influence my staff and I can give you 1 situation hospital that I had range. This is lacking in several areas in their processes and following state sidelines. So I picked up on this so. Got together a team from my staff fixed.

Please text the new policies and competencies and by positively employing some implementing all that when this taking the visit the Department of Health. And the Joint Commission on the accreditation of hospitals. Without flowering reviews in the operating room.	1
Yes, situation in which I was able to positively influence the action of others. I am currently a teacher. Assistant working with special education and behavior issue. Students at Middle School and I started with a class 3 years ago, they were 6 graders self contained class very challenging. Initially they did not like me, I was an outsider. I moved here from the East Coast. They didn't trust me. It was very difficult every day, I came in and gave it my best, then stay positive and energetic and enthusiastic and obviously patience and perseverance then by the end of the year. I had gained their trust. They had started doing work doing what they were told to do and 3 years later. They just graduated from 8th grade and they high. Five me when they see me in the hallway, I see them out in the. Community at local high school football games, they seek me out is then miss them your favorite teacher so. Again very challenging but very gratifying an again with a lot of work in patients than enerji. I was able to turn many of those students around make them realize that education is so important. And that really. I just wanted the best for best for them and they could be as successful as they could. And. Heading off to high school and then beyond I do have a quick student thing from last year, I get several letters and thank you. Dear miss them. Thank you for having thank you for being so amazing.

With the ski club that we run for the Plymouth Canton School District. We have a lot of opportunities. To influence The being either of kids so it's only kids to be responsible for keeping themselves warm is something that sounds so obvious and so basic. But if we control that one guys wearing a helmet an that helmets benefit. We have seen a rise. In the use of helmets, an have convinced quite a few parents to buy helmets for kids.	1
When I see a situation that I was able to positively influence. The actions of others with before when I worked at New Jersey Transit I was a rail traffic controller. You know, kind of like your traffic, but on the ground so you know that those jobs are very stressful. Basically. What had happened was I had an incident with one of my conductors who was dealing with a not so pleasant? I swear on the training. Now I'm based in a remote facility. So I'm not there at all, so the only thing that they have to go. By is by you know, my tone of voice and. The directions that I'm telling them to answer 2 or to go through so basically. I can cover this individual was like mentally disabled so basically I needed that conductor to bring his tone of voice down. And what you do when you know in customer service. I'm sure you guys know it. If you have an irate customer. You don't match that customer you set the tone for the communication so I was talking to my conductor. In a very calm, you know manner, where I was calming him down. So he was less riled and. You know less concerned about the situation that was at hand and he was able to bring that communication style. To the customer who's having some very issues regarding the ticket that was no longer valid anymore, so when that conductor matched. My tone of voice I can hear on phones that the customers from voice starts matched my conductor as well. So I was really proud of that moment being able to help my conductor navigated situation that they didn't really. They weren't really prepared for.	1
A situation where I'm positively able to influence the actions of others. I work at cracker ill as a server in as a shift leader, which is essentially like.

Hi I first of all I wanna say thank you for the opportunity for this interview I am truly honored. And hold some part of the functions mentally as the Food and beverage manager at the end of her. Repair service regions where my actions have been positive for the group. And I take care of the training in the restaurant. I work in enterprise on being patient understanding and listening to the client switches. Most important when you're sensitive difficult situation. I also teach them how to take briefing seriously when the client is concerned. And so mad about the situation of breeding helpful out to yoga classes so it helps I know and. And promote a positive thinking I promote seen in a positive and optimistic attitude and all always wonderful situation that comes with power. Over by inches. Really matter concerned about something and just take the. Run torch manager and have them take care of the situation. But basically I teach all the employees are come to work at the restaurant.

As the product and marketing specialist of Old Navy. I have been able to. Positively influence the actions of others by just encourage ING them and. Wanting them to do the best they can in the work that they're doing. Definition is a shipment position and so you know, people don't come in very motivated. They don't really want to do the work that they're given because. It starts at 5:30 in the morning who is awake at 5:30 in the morning but just coming in with a lively spirit. And. Spelling being example to them as to pay like let's get this done so we can go home early. Or let's do great works that way. The customers could have a great shopping experience I think that is one of the? One of the main ways, I have been able to. Positively influence the actions of other people.	1
So when I was in the Navy at my job wasn't inflate technician an as unemployed. Technician my job is to fix whatever is broken on the plane. Whether it's before, during or after the flight just to make sure that we're prepared and so. Before the flight, we would we had an issue, one time where one of the critical equipment was down. And I had no other option. We had to fix that before we could fly, otherwise you wouldn't be able to fly. And the pilots were on us like we need to take off and either take off. And instead of just like jumping in there like OK well. You're in charge like let me just do whatever you want. I had to sit down. I had to calm red flame to the pilots like Sir. I'm really. I really apologize that we have to. You know the way the flight, but it's gonna take me 20 more minutes. Then, like to fix this piece of equipment and then we can fly safely. It won't break the entire flight and then we will have to come home early. And so I think that positively influence their actions to delay the flight 20 more minutes. Even though that's not what they wanted to do and that's not like. Actually, that's all anybody wanted to do everybody wanted us to take off and everybody had a lot of pressure on me to get the equipment working. Alright influence there. Actions to allow me to finish my job and to make sure that the equipment was 100% safe. Before moving forward because I wanted to make sure that during the flight and post light. I will going to have to. Either turn the plane around early or. Will stay all night trying to fix this piece of equipment in order to come back tomorrow to fly again. So I think that is where I really positively influenced pretty much the entire crew to delay the flight.	1
Yes, I did turn it right now and we had a bunch of delays one night. And there is an autistic kid on board. Another budget and it was very nervous and the mom was worried about the situation. So I personally have had experience with autistic children, my cousin is autistic. An I was comforting him reassuring, I was calling the pilots and letting her and talk to them and I was offering him. Max and rings just to make sure that he was comfortable and understanding what was going on and that we were trying to help the situation as much as possible to get us. Back to get him back to his home.	1
Usually bribery in implementing this using other it's all about being T. Martin just kinda helping role model as to how you want them to represent the company. And when is it practice that I enjoy is making sure that every passenger on flight is greeted with a smile? And once I do that, it seems like everybody seems to follow and they see the captain will see that that is. I'm working with will help as well, and we all pretty much just mimic the same type of energy when it's a positive energie makes it the fact that I gave because? Solitaire.	1
A situation where I could say that a positively influence the actions of others well. I'm not sure how far I can go back but. Hopefully this works. I used to be a part of the dance team back in high school and just naturally. I do have a happy go lucky positive. Optimistic outlook on life. Just like goals is anything that I can get my hands on I'm just a positive individual well, we didn't win. So, like I said, I wasn't dancing. We didn't win that Friday night without a football game and a lot of us. The dancers were said. You know their boyfriends were football players so they didn't get a chance to. You know they don't want to celebrate or anything like that, but basically they went home with sour look on her face. For me. Just seeing the fun optimistic positive one, I like to just like. Be able to make people laugh. I love to be able to make people laugh because laughter is something that. Compressor on a persons face as well as you'll be able to remember the moment and laughter in one of the best medicines. So being able to. Make my my teenage room damping laugh that was something that was it was good because it put A. Hey, Brian, the mood when everyone was feeling down and out because of the game. We lost so just the action of just being able to be myself. And be positive be outgoing it. It really helps right in the moon and everyone felt a little bit better. I don't know if they need it.	1
I well in my previous job we would do morning huddles. And just growing up, having a positive attitude, I believe. That influences the room just being you know. Starting with a positive attitude and just. Um. Cheering everybody on you know, but I feel like. Basically lights up the room and it gets boring for the day of work.	1
An application where I think I was possibly able to influence the actions of others was while I was in college. I played pennies for for the tennis team in my school. That's the reason I came 1st in the United States. And uhm actually looks at him work all the time and I constantly influence. All my all my teammates to to win a match when we were having a really time much. We all have to to help each other to support each other to to really be able to to to make. To win or even if we lose but you have a positive impact on our group, not to not to stress not to feel. Sign so I think by by being able to be in the Tennessee man having this opportunity, I was really. Able to to influence people and possibly by also being I consider myself a very calm person an unfriendly.

As I was able to positively influence the actions of others was when I was a flight attendant for Sun Country Airlines. And I had a Decapitated passenger D capacitate? Are deep seated passengers. On my flight and it happened during boarding when you're on the ground in JFK airport. The situation was that there was a passenger that looked like she was ill. And she sat down in her seat and there were. Customers around her that we're noticing that she was. Unresponsive I was in the back alley and I had noticed everyone kind of looking at her funny. So I ran up. To her quickly and I sent her an WE? Figured out that she was unresponsive. And so I quickly got an able bodied person. To lift her up to the back alley and bring her to the back. For CPR I immediately thought the CPR going and I got the Ed out and the lead flight attendant. Associated over the intercom asking if there was any nurses any doctors on the flight and. We ought to work. We were. Doing CPR for quite a while, it was about 45 minutes until the. Paramedics came so it was an unfortunate circumstance because we did the best we could however. I believe in that situation, I took initiative action and. I got everyone to get involved in. Be part of this situation and even though it ended up not. Having a way that we wanted. We still I still demonstrated that I could possibly take action. Thank you.	1

So a time when I was able to positively influence the actions of others was as I'm across coach. There's obviously multiple times where? You have players who can either get down on themselves or when there are times where we're celebrating so much victory. Sometimes we can sort of lose ourselves in those victory. And a time that that happened was actually this past year where my girls that I coached for. We actually went to the playoffs in one of our lacrosse games and. Everything went great warm up with amazing practice is amazing. We trained and trained and trained and we were so full. Like we were so excited ecstatic to be in the in the position that we were in to be able to go to the playoffs. Everybody was just. Extatic. When we get to the playoffs and. There was a time where? It was one of those games where one was filled with bone after another. The game is getting out of control and my girls. Did start to kind of lose? Their momentum. And they started getting down on themselves and kind of. Pushing back each other, we at this point we're down by 3 points and everybody was just kind of losing their momentum throughout the whole entire game. And it's approach to be half time. And I kinda just have to take a step back and say, Hey look. This is what's happening right now at this point at halftime. We're at were down now by 4 points. We can either look at this as a loss and choke it up and we can all kind of. Go home but that's not what I want and I really hope that that's not what any of you girls want. As a coach like I had to do I had to do whatever it took for my girls to kind of you know, see the potential that they really did have. And not let them get so down on themselves and so eventually we kind of push each other back up and. We ended up winning the championship game, and we went to States and it. We didn't win. But it was the best experience that we had where we were able to push each other up.	1
So there have been many times that I positively influence other people when it comes to my actions, but I've realized that. When it comes to my actions to positively influence people I have to kill people with kindness and I realized that. In certain situations where somebody is negatively looking at life or negatively. You know experiencing life. I realize that it's best to kill people with kindness and. I realize that that's the best action when it comes to life in general is to to use the kindness and sweetness of yourself, too. So humble yourself into to better yourself and to me personally, I I've. I've had situations where people have been unruly and and disgruntled. And I realized that when it comes to dealing with anybody who's disgruntled or unruly that's the best situation. In that aspect is to basically you know kill people with kindness and I feel like that's the only time that I've ever seen you know. It actually work is is. When you kill people with kindness. You basically are able to influence the way that they look at you perceive you and to me personally. Such power been able to you know use my actions to influence people.	1

It was sort of a cold day and by cold than it was super cold in the fact that it was about 20 below. Nearest snow everywhere and remember, it's just not having a good time, we had some training to do, we're cold we retire we're hungry? But I was able to do was to take that really just awful day and say, Hey, it's snowing outside. It just means we have better like to do our work. It just means that we're able to not sweat as much work. Just take a positive spin on everything. And ultimately image. Myself and the rest is soldiers go alright. We can make the best verse sure it's cold. But that just means we can wear our warm fuzzy coat and the happy with their and it makes it. Easier to conceal yourself while doing certain sort of tactical maneuvers. Uh. This is one of my favorite times. I was in the military doing tech support movements when. That was The main thing that happened was that I had to listen to all of my other soldiers because I was high ranking them them. I had to listen to their grievances and I had to listen to why they were unhappy and I was also. Able to articulate to them. Hey it's going to be fine. I'll get you some cheerleader a compromise was made. Between myself and my shoulders and it was just a better day for everybody.	1
So that when I used to work with the Intercoastal Group. We used to do marketing for AT&T. So we would have to go door to door at times, you know being that our corporate trainer I used to. Choose to go door to door times, so a lot. There was very limited limited amount of women they used to be. At our company and the woman over there used to be very afraid of getting to go out there. Can meet people door to door and really just put themselves out there? I'm so me being that I've always been outspoken and I've never been afraid to step up and trying things. I decided to start going by myself, You know before the rest of the girls fit and I began to give them that model. And show them that look we can do this like yeah, we're girls and yeah, I know you're afraid of. What the possibilities of what can happen, but you know what can happen if we? How do we know what's gonna happen if we don't? Get out there and at least try so I was able to show these girls that by going out there and putting myself out there and getting it done. They can do it, too, and soon enough deferral started getting out there and doing their jobs, too. And they started getting great at it and they started to like it. Next thing you know they started getting people fighting up with us and a lot of people started getting the fiber optics with AT&T. And if you know if I didn't get bowling put myself out there and try to create myself as this role model for these other women. Who knows if they would have followed in my footsteps and I've been as successful as they are today? You know, I don't like to brag and say that you know it's because of me, but you know. These girls were afraid at some point and I am glad that I was a part of getting to help them out and get them out of their shells.	1

Felt that there was a disconnect with our customer service. We never we don't have a customer service Department. They just hired me and I kind of took over a customer service role that wasn't really even there. My job, I can't need and decided to work with it and from that, they notice that they were missing. And customer service Department and they have. Creative ones around now in the process of creating a Department in which they would like me to train people.

It was a short as I forget exactly what it was, but there was definitely the shortage of a specific ingredient or a specific type of food that we were serving. And. Instead of going to the back and just refilling seeing something simple instead of going in. Getting a preparing and bring it to the front and then creating things right with creating the food exactly the right way. There were other people in the mind that were just put a different ingredient, not being that may sound like a small thing but. More of the you know as a customer. You you want you or something like that. You want to get. What I what I did ask it was like I said simple right just wanted to back again prepared and I brought it to. The other workers of attention that Hey, you know if we are. Keep working with the team working professionally and you know this is the place that pays as we should do things right. And I kind of had that small conversation with him and just kind of help them realize it's like Hey. Given. What you want to receive not to give us rocky will respect you have to give it as well? It's just. Basically, I was just able to go ahead and. Let them know him and realized that quality matters, no matter what, if you want to have something with your own later on.

We connected with the people there. We were able to work in an orphanage and we were able to. Ann. Do some work that needed to be done in the area and care for some of these children that. We're in the orphanage and so in that situation, it was definitely rewarding experience, but it was also challenging and not. I have to be organized I had to take a leadership role and make sure that everyone was able to. Make it on the trip safely that we got to our destination and follow the itinerary that was that. Out in so and not offer in that situation, I was able to use the experience that I had.

We only had a 15 minute delay that everyone will make their flight so all the people that were going to get up and get off of the flight. I felt a little bit better an I went through the aisles and I made sure that I let people know. And I just make sure that I looked at different flight times and let them know that if they didn't make their flight. There will be another one that will be 30 minutes to an hour after in that they would make it to their destination on time.	1

When that When that question came up, I was the one who went to all the the training and and and went. You know far ahead and did my extra steps to be able to get to that point where you know, I was confident. I knew the procedures in the policies and things like that, and so on, and and.
